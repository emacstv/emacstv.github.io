This essentially provides a natural language query capability for almost anything Emacs can do.  It is the model for how these integrations can really impact development beyond the neat generation that captivated some early on.\n\n  The prototype tools are available on our Private Github and being updated as\n  they are improved.  The notes on the configuration seen in the demos are mostly ready for reading in the lunch/drafts folder within our Private YouTube\n  repository.  We look forward to open sourcing this after launching PrizeForge,\n  which has a superior funding model that doesn't depend on paywalling.\n\n  Support us!  We are bringing the necessary shake-up to open source funding,\n  which will be critical if the next two decades will be built with open technologies enforcing competitive dynamics and providing the healthy alternatives that lead to more progress faster and healthier markets with less\n  stagnation from dominant incumbents.\n\n  More LLM backend support is needed in GPTel.  We would like to help on the R1 integration since it's a cheap and powerful model at the moment with a lot of open source locally running options.

The tests are a success.  This is just the beginning.\n\n  The demos use manuals, completions, source code, docstrings, and other facilities to let the LLM traverse facts and more deductively arrive at useful conclusions.\n\n  Source code for tools in the demo (subscribers exclusive!):\n  https://github.com/positron-solutions/youtube/blob/master/lunch/09-retreival-augmented-macros/demo-gptel-config.el\n\n  Our Github Sponsors\n  https://github.com/sponsors/positron-solutions\n\n  GPTel for Emacs:\n  https://github.com/karthink/gptel\n\n  These techniques will scale across any language.  By using these techniques within Emacs to make our Emacs usage more efficient, we are in a very tight feedback loop with very high headroom.  Editors like Cursor don't really have anything to offer over programmable tools where the programmers employ LLMs to their problems rather than waiting for the IDE to come to them.\n\n  Since Common Lisp is a good Lisp to reason about Lisp and other languages, it might just turn out that LLMs turn into a killer application for lisp-like languages.  Since Lem is an Emacs, there's an intriguing possibility that we're witnessing a turning point in the making.\n\n  #programming #llm #opensource\n\n  TIMESTAMPS\n  00:00 Welcome\n  00:28 Retrieval Augmented Emacs\n  03:22 The Problems Being Solved\n  05:27 Not Even the Best Available\n  06:22 Why This is Huge"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"The Extreme Digital Nomad","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14KNPxEe1hU","DURATION":"2:25","DATE":"2025-02-08T19:45:11-08:00","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"The Augmented Software Engineer - Ep.15 - Emacs/Local","DESCRIPTION":"The blog post - https://tedn.life/2024/10/24/the-augmented-software-engineer-what-is-it/\n  The problems - https://aperiodic.net/pip/scala/s-99/\n  The repo - https://github.com/rolandtritsch/99-scala3-problems\n  The emacs config - https://github.com/rolandtritsch/emacs.d"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"Raoul Comninos","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z38_FhNKHuY","DURATION":"2:47","DATE":"2025-02-08T08:37:03-08:00","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Quickly delete all lines containing a string #emacs #coding #programming","DESCRIPTION":"https://mega.nz/file/ez4wiaZC#cUir8-1vaycl8k1ox_OqbU-uqWGsrSwgqQwwlrmJfOU\n\n  PLEASE CONSIDER SUPPORTING ME.\n  You can support me on PayPal:\n  https://paypal.me/revrari\n  Or you can send me some Bitcoin:\n  3JToybg7LHAdsteTYGg7jRniRZEMCeTasj"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"Chris Maiorana","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKZBGmxglwU","DURATION":"11:35","DATE":"2025-02-08T05:20:36-08:00","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Export From Emacs to Microsoft Word Format (The Whole Writing Process)","DESCRIPTION":"Most publishers and editors to whom you submit your writing will require a .docx (Microsoft Word) document.

If the process involves dynamic, real-time adjustments, it could also be associated with **\"dynamic knowledge management\"** or **\"adaptive knowledge organization.\"**\n\n  The process of arranging elementary objects in a dynamic knowledge repository, such as in **RCD Notes** and **Hyperscope** within GNU Emacs, is conceptually similar to moving **Org headings** up or down in an Org mode file. In Org mode, headings serve as the fundamental building blocks of structured information, and rearranging them allows users to dynamically organize and prioritize content. Similarly, in a dynamic knowledge repository, elementary objects (such as notes, concepts, or data points) are manipulated‚Äîmoved up, down, or reordered‚Äîto reflect evolving relationships, hierarchies, or priorities. Both processes involve a flexible, user-driven approach to structuring information, enabling adaptive organization and efficient retrieval within a hierarchical or relational framework.\n\n  RCD Notes & Hyperscope for GNU Emacs, The Dynamic Knowledge Repository:\n  https://gnu.support/gnu-emacs/rcd-notes-for-gnu-emacs/index.html"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"guix.social","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQpwf4jgpGo","DURATION":"1:04:03","DATE":"2025-01-19T06:57:20-08:00","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":arei:scheme:nrepl:","TAGS":":arei:scheme:nrepl:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"A Modern and Extensible IDE for Guile Scheme","DESCRIPTION":"Andrew Tropin (https://trop.in) introduces Emacs-Arei a modern, extensible IDE for Guile Scheme.

That's why which-key is great. It used to be a separate package, but it's now part of Emacs 30. You just have to turn on which-key mode, and then, if you hesitate in the middle of a keyboard shortcut, Emacs will show you what you can do. It turns out that you can customize this menu,so here are some tweaks I'm trying. First, I want to change ~which-key-sort-order~ to the one that sorts by description. This groups similar functions together. Then I want to change the labels using ~which-key-replacement-alist~. Let's try it without the dashes between words. Now let's turn on multiple replacements and make things even simpler. I can even use Unicode to make it easier to spot certain commands. And of course there's an Elisp way to customize all of this. I want to see if these little tweaks can help me use Emacs better. If you use which-key, maybe you'll also want to customize your menu. Let me know what you figure out!\n\n  #emacs"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"33:24","SPEAKERS":"TOKYO FM Podcasts | AuDee by TOKYO FM","DATE":"2025-01-05T19:17:11-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPw1zl0WObQ","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"„Äê2025Âπ¥ÊúÄÂàù„ÅÆ„ÉÜ„Éº„Éû„ÅØEmacsÔºÅÔºü„Äë„Ç®„É≥„Ç∏„Éã„Ç¢„ÅÆÊ•ΩÂúí vim-jp „É©„Ç∏„Ç™ #25","DESCRIPTION":"„Ç®„É≥„Ç∏„Éã„Ç¢„Ç≥„Éü„É•„Éã„ÉÜ„Ç£„Äåvim-jp„Äç„ÅÆ„É©„Ç∏„Ç™Áâà„Å®„Åó„Å¶„Çπ„Çø„Éº„Éà„Åó„Åü„Äå„Ç®„É≥„Ç∏„Éã„Ç¢„ÅÆÊ•ΩÂúí vim-jp „É©„Ç∏„Ç™„Äç„ÄÇ\n\n\n\n\n  ‰ªäÂõû„ÅØ„ÄÅtadsan„Åï„Çì„Å®„Åü„Åë„Å¶„ÅÉ„Åï„Çì„Çí„ÅäËøé„Åà„Åó„Åæ„ÅôÔºÅ\n\n  ‰ªäÂõû„ÅÆ„ÉÜ„Éº„Éû„ÅØ„ÄåVim„ÅÆÂº∑Êïµ(„Å®„ÇÇ)Emacs„Äç\n  php-mode„Åª„ÅãËâ≤„ÄÖ„Å™elisp„Çí„É°„É≥„ÉÜ„Éä„É≥„Çπ„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çãtadsan„Åï„Çì„ÄÇ\n  „Åù„Åó„Å¶„ÄÅÊúÄËøë„ÅÆÊù±‰∫¨EmacsÂãâÂº∑‰ºö„Çí‰∏ªÂÇ¨„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Åü„Åë„Å¶„ÅÉ„Åï„Çì„ÄÇ\n\n\n  Êñ∞Âπ¥ÊúÄÂàù„ÅÆ„Äåvim-jp „É©„Ç∏„Ç™„Äç„ÅØEmacsÂõû„Çí„ÅäÂ±ä„Åë„Åó„Åæ„ÅôÔºÅ\n\n\n\n  ÔΩûÔΩûÔΩû\n\n  „Ç®„É≥„Ç∏„Éã„Ç¢„ÅåÈõÜ„Åæ„Çã„Ç§„É≥„Çø„Éº„Éç„ÉÉ„Éà‰∏ä„ÅÆ„Ç≥„Éü„É•„Éã„ÉÜ„Ç£vim-jp„Åã„ÇâÁîü„Åæ„Çå„ÅüÂàù„ÅÆÈü≥Â£∞„Éó„É≠„Ç∞„É©„É†„ÄÇ\n  „Äåtomoya„Äç„Å®„Äå„ÅÇ„Çä„Åô„Åà„Äç„Åå„Éë„Éº„ÇΩ„Éä„É™„ÉÜ„Ç£„ÇíÊãÖÂΩìÔºÅ\n\n  vim-jp„ÅØ„Éó„É≠„Ç∞„É©„Éü„É≥„Ç∞„Åã„ÇâÂ≠êËÇ≤„Å¶„Å´Ëá≥„Çã„Åæ„ÅßÁÑ°Êï∞„ÅÆ„ÉÅ„É£„É≥„Éç„É´„ÇíÊä±„Åà„Åü„Ç≥„Éü„É•„Éã„ÉÜ„Ç£„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ\n  „Åù„Çì„Å™„Ç≥„Éü„É•„Éã„ÉÜ„Ç£„ÅÆÈù¢ÁôΩ„Åï„ÇíÁîü„Åã„Åó„Å¶„ÄÅÂêÑÂàÜÈáé„ÅÆÊßò„ÄÖ„Å™„Ç≤„Çπ„Éà„Çí‰∫§„Åà„Å™„Åå„ÇâÊ•Ω„Åó„ÅèÈõëË´á„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åç„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ\n\n  vim-jp„ÅÆSlack„Å∏„ÅÆ„ÅîÂèÇÂä†„ÅØ„Åì„Å°„Çâ (https://vim-jp.org/docs/chat.html) „Åã„ÇâÔºÅ\n\n  „É°„ÉÉ„Çª„Éº„Ç∏„ÅØSlack„ÅÆ #vim-jp-radio-message „ÉÅ„É£„É≥„Éç„É´„Å´ÊäïÁ®ø„Åó„Å¶„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ„ÄÇ\n\n\n  vim-jp„É©„Ç∏„Ç™„Éª„Ç™„É™„Ç∏„Éä„É´„Ç∞„ÉÉ„Ç∫„ÅØ„Åì„Å°„Çâ (https://suzuri.jp/vim-jp-radio) „Åã„ÇâÔºÅ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  OP„Éª ED„ÉÜ„Éº„ÉûÂà∂‰ΩúÔºöÁî∞‰∏≠ÊΩ§Ôºà„Ç≤„É≥„Éà„Ç¶„Ç≠Ôºâ (http://www.gentouki.jp)"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"7:50","SPEAKERS":"The Linux Cast","DATE":"2025-01-05T18:36:46-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYqJx9GQutE","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":community:","TAGS":":community:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"This Time Is Going to Be Different.

I'd like to interface with it using Emacs Lisp. Can you provide some starting points for implementing this integration?\"\n\n  Answer by the LLM (llama-3.3-70b-versatile):\n\n  **Getting Started with Process Handling in Emacs Lisp**\n\n  Emacs Lisp provides a robust way to interact with external\n  processes. To handle a program that sends STDIN and receives STDOUT in\n  Emacs Lisp, you can use the following functions and concepts:\n\n  ### 1. Creating a Process\n\n  * `start-process`: This function creates a new process and runs the specified program.\n  * `make-process`: This function creates a new process without running a program.\n\n  Example:\n  ```elisp\n  (let ((proc (start-process \"my-process\" \"my-buffer\" \"my-program\")))\n    ...)\n  ```\n  ### 2. Sending Input (STDIN)\n\n  * `process-send-string`: This function sends a string to the process as input.\n  * `process-send-region`: This function sends a region of text to the process as input.\n\n  Never anthropomorphise üôÖ the Large Language Model (LLM) üíª!\n\n  Example:\n  ```elisp\n  (process-send-string proc \"Hello, world!\")\n  ```\n\n  ### 3. Receiving Output (STDOUT)\n\n  * `set-process-filter`: This function sets a filter function to process the output of a process.\n  * `process-filter`: This function can be used to process the output of a process.\n\n  Example:\n  ```elisp\n  (set-process-filter proc (lambda (proc string) (message string)))\n  ```\n  ### 4. Handling Process Completion\n\n  * `set-process-sentinel`: This function sets a sentinel function to process the completion of a process.\n  * `process-sentinel`: This function can be used to process the completion of a process.\n\n  Example:\n  ```elisp\n  (set-process-sentinel proc (lambda (proc event) (message \"Process completed: %s\" event)))\n  ```\n  ### Putting it All Together\n\n  Here's a simple example of how you might handle a process that sends STDIN and receives STDOUT in Emacs Lisp:\n  ```elisp\n  (let ((proc (start-process \"my-process\" \"my-buffer\" \"my-program\")))\n    (set-process-filter proc (lambda (proc string) (message string)))\n    (set-process-sentinel proc (lambda (proc event) (message \"Process completed: %s\" event)))\n    (process-send-string proc \"Hello, world!\"))\n  ```\n  Remember to replace `\"my-program\"` with the actual command you want to run, and `\"my-buffer\"` with the actual buffer where you want to display the output.\n\n  ### Additional Tips\n\n  * Use `with-current-buffer` to switch to the buffer where the process output is being displayed.\n  * Use `insert` or `insert-and-inherit` to insert the output into the buffer.\n  * Use `process-exit-status` to check the exit status of the process.\n  * Use `delete-process` to delete the process when it's no longer needed.\n\n  Video wrongly says it was mixtral-8x7b-32768, no, it was llama-3.3-70b-versatile.\n\n  Thanks for watching! üëÄ\n\n  What is Free Software? - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation\n  https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\n\n  GNU Emacs - GNU Project\n  https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"15:23","SPEAKERS":"Positron's Emacs Channel","DATE":"2024-12-28T21:34:15-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQXMA2OQ0uY","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":org:sharing:presentation:dslide:","TAGS":":org:sharing:presentation:dslide:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Putting the D(slide) in E(D)itor Macros","DESCRIPTION":"Dslide 0.6.1 has keyboard macros and greatly invigorated babel integration.

This mode allows you to integrate with the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) and debug your code directly within Emacs.\n\n**DAP Mode vs. LSP DAP Mode**\n\nThere are two main DAP modes for Emacs: the newer DAP mode and the older LSP DAP mode. DAP mode is more closely aligned with Emacs Lisp primitives, making it more flexible and powerful. However, LSP DAP mode is simpler to set up and works well with LSP servers.\n\n**Debugging a Go Project**\n\nTo illustrate, I'll use a Go project as an example. First, I'll set a breakpoint using a custom function that highlights the line for better visibility. This function is a workaround for a known issue with breakpoint markers being hidden.\n\n**Starting the Debugger**\n\nI'll start the debugging session using a configuration file that specifies the debugger (dlv in this case), the program to debug, and other relevant settings. Once the debugger starts, you'll see the current scope, variables, and logs in the Emacs window.\n\n**Interacting with the Debugger**\n\nYou can interact with the debugger using various commands:\n\n- **Stepping:** Step over, into, or out of functions.\n- **Breakpoints:** Set, clear, and condition breakpoints.\n- **Variables:** Inspect variable values.\n- **Expressions:** Evaluate expressions.\n\n**Integration with LSP**\n\nDAP mode integrates seamlessly with LSP, providing features like:\n\n- **Code completion:** Suggest variable and function names.\n- **Go-to-definition:** Jump to the definition of a symbol.\n- **Hover documentation:** Display documentation for symbols.\n\n**Debugging Tests**\n\nTo debug tests, I use a custom function that automatically sets up the debugger for the current test function. This function leverages the `go-test` library to identify the test and start the debugger with the appropriate arguments.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDAP mode is a powerful tool for debugging your code within Emacs.

If my player is somewhere in the current subtitle, it'll use that timestamp. If not, it'll make a reasonable guess based on character position.\n\n  I can use subed-word-data.el to load word-level times from WhisperX JSON or from Youtube SRV2 files. This allows me to split a subtitle using the timestamp for that word.\n\n  Because subed-word-data colours words based on transcription confidence, I can see where something might need to be closely examined, like when there's no timing information for the words at the start or end.\n\n  If I combine that with subed-waveform, I can see silences.

I use WhisperX to transcribe my recording, and I use a little bit of Emacs Lisp to figure out timestamps for each word. I edit this to fix errors. I can even rearrange things and get rid of anything I don't want.Then I use subed-convert to turn it into a VTT file. I can tweak the start and end times by looking at the waveforms. Then I add comments with the visuals I want. I can add images, animated GIFs, or videos, and they're automatically squeezed or stretched to fit. I can also have them play at original speed. Then I set up open captions and use subed-record-compile-video.

It is based on the idea that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to link between them.\n\n  Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to \"notes\".  It can be used for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs, such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.\n\n  - Package name (GNU ELPA): `denote`\n  - Official manual: https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote\n  - Change log: https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote-changelog\n  - Git repo on SourceHut: https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote\n    - Mirrors:\n      - GitHub: https://github.com/protesilaos/denote\n      - GitLab: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/denote\n  - Mailing list: https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote\n  - Video demo: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-06-18-denote-demo/\n  - Backronyms: Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses.

I want to get into unit testing with the `ert` package that is built into Emacs.  **The video will be recorded and can be watched later.**\n\n  I have never written unit tests before.  I want to learn them as a general skill, but also because I want `denote` to have comprehensive tests in place before its next major release.\n\n  I understand I am announcing this without much prior notice (current time 13:02 +0300).  No worries!\n\n  ## About Denote\n\n  Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to link between them.\n\n  Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to \"notes\".  It can be used for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs, such as videos.  Naming files in a constistent way makes their filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.\n\n  + Package name (GNU ELPA): `denote`\n  + Official manual: https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote\n  + Change log: https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote-changelog\n  + Git repo on SourceHut: https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote\n    - Mirrors:\n      + GitHub: https://github.com/protesilaos/denote\n      + GitLab: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/denote\n  + Mailing list: https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote\n  + Video demo: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-06-18-denote-demo/\n  + Backronyms: Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses.

But start with the basics!\n\n  Headings\n  Everything in org mode starts with headings in files. You open a file (with a .org extension, and you start adding headings.\n\n  Headings are identified by asterisks (*, or ‚Äústars‚Äù) and they are hierarchical, which means they can be nested in multiple levels.\n\n  * Heading level 1\n  ** Heading level 2\n  *** Heading level 3 (and so forth)\n\n  Headings can be rearranged in any order by holding down the Meta (or, Alt) key and using the arrows on your keyboard.\n\n  Tags\n\n  Tags are used to additional context to heading items.\n\n  To add a tag, you can hover over a heading and click C-c C-c. You will be prompted to add a tag. Tab auto completion works here as well, if you want to assign an existing tag.\n\n  Lists\n  Org mode offers some powerful list-making tools. You can use dashes to start lists:\n\n  - Item 1\n  - Item 2\n  - Item 3\n  Then you can check boxes to these lists:\n\n  - [ ] Take out garbage\n  - [ ] Prepare tax declaration\n  - [ ] Start a business\n  You can check and uncheck these items with C-c C-c. (This keystroke does a lot of magical things in org mode.)\n\n  You can also use progress indicators to see how much of the list is complete:\n\n  - My list [/] [%]\n   - [ ] Take out garbage\n   - [ ] Prepare tax declaration\n   - [ ] Start a business\n  Watch the progress indicators move as you complete your list."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"51:33","SPEAKERS":"NapoleonWils0n","DATE":"2022-12-20T12:33:31-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQgwx59fmCQ&list=PL7hhhG5qUoXk266pUiPhm-gqBgM5P8vBV&index=24&pp=iAQB","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":launcher:","TAGS":":launcher:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"emacs app-launcher launch gui application by opening their desktop entries","DESCRIPTION":"Emacs app-launcher is a package that will launch gui application by opening their desktop entries.\n\n  It use the xdg specification and will open application installed with the system package manager like apt, snap, flatpak and nixpkgs\n\n  the app-launcher opens in the minibuffer and displays a list of the applications on your system with desktop entries, it doesnt display any icons next to the application but there is a open github issue request icon support from a year ago\n\n  After you select an application to launch the app-launcher window in the mini buffer automatically hides, the app-launcher use code from the Counsel package and one of the contributors is David Wilson from @SystemCrafters\n\n  app-launcher isnt in the melpa repo but can be installed with straight.el, use-package or by manually downloading the app-launcher.el into your ~/.config/emacs/lisp directory\n\n  to enable the app-launcher package add the following code to your emacs init.el file\n\n  (require 'app-launcher)\n\n  ;; app-launcher\n  (keymap-set global-map \"C-c d\" 'app-launcher-run-app)\n\n  to run the app-launcher package run the following command in the minibuffer\n\n  M-x app-launcher-run-app\n\n  you can also bind app-launcher-run-app to a keyboard shortcut\n\n  emacs app-laucher:\n  https://github.com/SebastienWae/app-launcher\n\n  emacs early-init.el\n  https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/ubuntu-dotfiles/blob/master/.config/emacs/early-init.el\n\n  emacs init.el\n  https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/ubuntu-dotfiles/blob/master/.config/emacs/init.el\n\n  it should also be possible to create an emacs frame that opens the app-launcher in the style of spotlight or alfred on the mac\n\n  emacs frames\n  https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/cerberus/blob/master/emacs/emacs-frames.org\n\n  location of desktop entries for apt, snap, flatpak and nixpkgs\n  https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/cerberus/blob/master/ubuntu/desktop-entries.org"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:17","SPEAKERS":"Super Data Science: ML & AI Podcast with Jon Krohn","DATE":"2022-12-19T11:00:05+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Cv0Pj_GS6A","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Spacemacs: Combining the best of Emacs and Vim","DESCRIPTION":"From the \"635: The Perils of Manually Labeling Data for Machine Learning Models\" in which @JonKrohnLearns speaks with Shayan Mohanty about the pitfalls of data analysis when bias comes into the equation (spoiler alert: it always does), the importance of the Chomsky hierarchy in data management, and the importance of simulation engines for returning real-time results to users.\n\n  Watch, listen to, or read the full episode at https://www.superdatascience.com/635"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"06:31","SPEAKERS":"VibinAndDancin","DATE":"2022-12-18T23:28:36+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmFCVc1l2zo","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Setting up and Using Emacs","DESCRIPTION":"A video showing how to install and setup Emacs with a demonstration of how to use it with python files.\n  List of commands used in the video:\n  remove bottom box: ctrl-x-1\n  undo: ctrl-/\n  copy: alt-w\n  paste: ctrl-y\n  cut: ctrl-w\n  save: ctrl-x-s"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"11:19","SPEAKERS":"qnnnp","DATE":"2022-12-18T22:36:59+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwH3IslQlCM","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":howm:","TAGS":":howm:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"0058.

Are you worried that your colleagues will expect more from you and that it would be safer to use VS Code or whatever the others are using? Here's how I solved that when I started out as a developer in 2003:\n\n  1) Setup the development stack that \"everyone\" around you are using (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse)\n  2) In your spare time, set up Emacs to do the same\n  3) Configure both editors to auto reload files so you can quickly Alt+Tab between them\n  4) As you grow into the job, so will your Emacs setup\n  5) As months go by, you'll use Emacs more and more and the \"everyone editor\" less and less.\n\n  With this approach, you can take your time to ease into the job, learn all the other things you must in order to deliver. At the same time, when time allows, you can re-create the setup using your preferred tools, like Emacs.\n\n  To have Emacs automatically reload files changed in VS Code, IntelliJ++, I use:\n  ```\n  (global-auto-revert-mode 1)\n  ```\n\n  ## My Emacs conf\n  - https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/tree/master/emacs\n\n  ## Connect\n  üï∏Ô∏è https://skybert.net\n  üêò https://emacs.ch/@skybert\n  üì´ torstein@skybert.net\n\n  #emacs #linux #newbie #newjob"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"17:48","SPEAKERS":"Tony Aldon","DATE":"2022-11-24T22:45:17+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbsCAS5zR64","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"How to modify headlines programmatically","DESCRIPTION":"- https://scripter.co/looping-through-org-mode-headings/\n  - https://github.com/kaushalmodi/"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"59:22","SPEAKERS":"NapoleonWils0n","DATE":"2022-11-23T16:49:04+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StbSdYcLucE","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Desktop Notification Center","DESCRIPTION":"The Emacs Desktop Notification Center (EDNC) is an Emacs package written in pure Lisp that implements a Desktop Notifications service according to the freedesktop.org specification.\n\n  EDNC aspires to be a small, but flexible drop-in replacement of standalone daemons like Dunst.\n\n  emacs desktop notification center\n  https://github.com/sinic/ednc\n\n  emacs init.el\n  https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/ubuntu-dotfiles/blob/master/.config/emacs/init.el\n\n  disable gnome notifications\n  https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/cerberus/blob/master/ubuntu/nognome_notifications_setup/nognome_notifications.org"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"25:59","SPEAKERS":"Tony Aldon","DATE":"2022-11-23T14:13:42+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypb6tBWaQfE","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Start reading Emacs Lisp code TODAY","DESCRIPTION":"https://github.com/tonyaldon/bfs"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"04:32","SPEAKERS":"ThePrimeagen","DATE":"2022-11-22T14:01:03+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNsWTWvm8uw","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Does Your Editor Matter?","DESCRIPTION":""},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"04:32","SPEAKERS":"ThePrimeagen","DATE":"2022-11-22T14:01:03+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNsWTWvm8uw","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Does Your Editor Matter?","DESCRIPTION":"### Twitch\n  Everything is built live on twitch\n  Twitch : https://bit.ly/3xhFO3E\n  Discord: discord.gg/ThePrimeagen\n  Spotify DevHour: https://open.spotify.com/show/4MLaDrQcQ5mi3rsnvWkwPt\n  ### Editor\n  All my videos are edited by Flip.

As with many programs, I wondered how much better this feature would be, if only it was inside Emacs. This talk explains how I made zmusic, my implementation inside Emacs, with detours through Emacs text properties, font rendering, the WAVE file format, and music theory.

This took longer than I expected, and I became frustrated with Emacs' lack of documentation on the one feature the entire editor is based on (modes). We do eventually get it working. After this, we decide to alter how functions are parsed in order to (hopefully) have less code duplication and better semantics when it comes to parsing types of function parameters, as well as the function return type itself. This is (like it sounds) kind of a giant task, so we don't finish this in this video, and end up getting stuck at a bug near the end of the stream. Luckily, we've figured out what the bug was caused by, and we will begin next stream by fixing the bug and moving on with our lives :^).\n\n  I do want to say I'm sorry for this stream :/. I feel like I didn't bring the proper mindset to the stream and I don't like how I treated some of the viewers and chatters while I was frustrated. It is something I will do my best to be better at; you viewers don't deserve having to listen to me yell at my computer screen why it's not working :p.

Honestly, I'm even embarrassed to post this video, and I wish I could just sweep it under the rug with no one noticing; alas, the video is part of the development of the compiler and therefore must be published. It would be kind of nonsense to just start tomorrow's stream like this one never happened, and I don't think it would be respectful to those who watched live. \\endrant :/\n\n  As always, thank you to all those who were able to make it live, and to all watching in the future.

Esto fue (como sospechaba) porque el comando 'cp' no copi√≥ el archivo. Esto no ocurre al clonar el repositorio, que adem√°s es la mejor pr√°ctica (o usando bien cp|rsync).\n   - Use Package tiene otra opci√≥n muy √∫til que no me di cuenta de comentar, y es defer, que permite retrasar la carga del paquete hasta que est√©s inactivo por N segundos.

Do you want all your desktop files visible on your linuxboot system, but just remembered there's no disk on your linuxboot system? Are you tired of using scp or wget to move files around? Do you want to run emacs or vim on the linuxboot machine, but know they can't ever fit? What about zsh? How about being able to run commands on your linuxboot machine and have the output appear on your home file system? You say you'd like to make this all work without having to ask your Sysadmin From Hell to Do Magic to your desktop?\n\n  Your search is over: cpu is here to answer all your usability needs.\n\n  CPU is a go implementation of Plan 9's cpu command. It uses the go ssh package, so all your communications are as secure as ssh. It can be started from /sbin/init or even replace /sbin/init, so you have teeny tiny flash footprint. You can see the code at github.com:u-root/cpu. It's also small: less than 20 files, including tests.\n\n  CPU runs as both a client (on your desktop) and an ssh server (on your linuxboot machine). On your desktop, it needs no special privilege. On the linuxboot system, it needs only fusermount. On the remote machine, it mounts a FUSE server into a process private name space at important places like /home/$USER, /bin, and so on. It implements remote file access by relaying FUSE requests via gorpc to a server embedded in the cpu command. The desktop command services those requests; you don't need to run a special external server.\n\n  CPU will change your life. You can forget about moving files via scp: once you 'cpu in', the /home directory on your linuxboot node is your home directory. You can cd ~ and see all your files. You can pick any shell you want, since the shell binary comes from your desktop, not flash. You don't have to worry about fitting zsh into flash ever again!"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"17:51","SPEAKERS":"iLemming","DATE":"2022-07-06T08:34:04+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlfFHTPq62A","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"I keep getting stuck in Emacs.

If I execute to this line it takes a few\n  07:38  seconds... it says Success!!! and now we can\n  07:40  show the .pdf. And: ta-da!\n  07:44  this is the figure that I wanted to show.\n  07:47  So, that's it. Again: this is a\n  07:53  library that is not interesting in\n  07:55  itself, but\n  07:56  i think that the way in which it can be\n  07:58  tested - which is very similar to the way\n  08:01  in which I'm developing it\n  08:03  is interesting in itself - so\n  08:05  if you are interested in test blocks\n  08:08  please test this,\n  08:10  and send feedback.

The user types an argument fragment, and Emacs suggests possible completions for that fragment. Completions make emacs faster and easier for the user.\n\n  Examples of when completions are used:\n    Run command (M-x)\n    Switch buffer (C-x b)\n    Find file (C-x C-f)\n    Get info (C-h R)\n    Etc.\n\n  Vertico is a nice Completion UI.\n\n  The full list of standard completion styles are provided by the variable completion-styles-alist.\n    orderless\n    emacs21\n    emacs22\n    basic\n    partial-completion\n    substring\n    flex\n    initials\n\n  You can set the completion styles you want to use with the variable completion-styles.\n  (setq completion-styles '(basic substring orderless))\n\n  Question: Since we're providing a list of styles, which one is used? Answer: Emacs will use the first style that produces results.\n\n  Question: How do I know how each style behaves? Answer: Use just one style and see how it behaves. Or read the Info Manual.\n\n  Question: Why does emacs prepend styles to the front of my completion-styles list? Answer: Emacs has a set of category styles that it prepends by default (see completion-category-defaults). You can override the defaults (see completion-category-overrides).\n\n  To learn more, see the Help for the variable above or see the Emacs code in minibuffer.el."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"09:35","SPEAKERS":"Bhaskar Chowdhury  ...Musing with GNU_Linux!!","DATE":"2022-02-12T22:17:16+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvQPGhd2WCU","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs: Search Engine Mode 2022_02_13_03:14:23","DESCRIPTION":"In this video, you will see, there is glue Engine mode, which you can integrate with GNU/Emacs to get the benefit of searching on the internet from within Emacs.\n\n  #linux #emacs #searchenginemode"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"36:13","SPEAKERS":"Brent Westbrook","DATE":"2022-02-12T19:03:55+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://youtu.be/vD3rxVTXIJo","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"User Scripts in mpv with Lua (with Lua LSP setup in Emacs)","DESCRIPTION":"In this video I work on a script for the mpv media player that allows me to hit a key binding to record a time stamp for these videos.

It is unique as a bookmark manager in that it is designed to interoperate as part of a larger system of personal knowledge management and productivity tools.\n  It achieves this interoperability by saving your data into an accessible plain text file written in the emacs standard org-mode format. Org mode is a set of plain text tools used to manage tasks, to do lists, notes, links, journal entries and almost any form of text-based information.\n\n  Most org mode users interact with it via the emacs text editor but it can be used in any text editor and is increasingly used as a format by other tools such as the LogSeq* personal knowledge manager, the Flat Habits iOS ToDo manager and Plain Org an iOS org-mode editor.\n\n  Here I show how the notes, links and todo items captured by BrainTool in your browser can be accessed and edited in org mode and then used to drive a task manager. The same plain text file is also shown synced to LogSeq and being navigated in the LogSeq user interface.\n\n  All three tools are automatically kept in sync by virtue of using the same org mode file as backing store. Currently this requires syncing BrainTool to a Google Drive file and using the Google Sync app to sync your GDrive to a desktop folder. Emacs and LogSeq can then read and write the BrainTool data file locally. Some care needs to be taken to allow time for the local and remote files to sync before moving between tools.\n\n  If you are new to BrainTool the other videos in this playlist give a short introduction."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"02:44","SPEAKERS":"Anand Tamariya","DATE":"2022-01-27T12:07:02+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6HSf5D6TtA&list=PLW9poAEUvGDAMYvvznljaNtvooaJZxsFQ&index=10&pp=iAQB","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"GNU Emacs: A multimedia editor","DESCRIPTION":"Use GNU Emacs for simple multimedia editing tasks.\n\n\n  Details: https://lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/2022/01/gnu-emacs-multimedia-editor.html"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"09:54","SPEAKERS":"Blackberry Boy","DATE":"2022-01-27T03:00:04+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE1erKgmEMg","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":org:","TAGS":":org:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Org-mode - Let us start using LaTex","DESCRIPTION":"I have recently started using LaTex for majority of my document production like writing client proposals, creating reports and even my resume.

Kl√ºwer, DNV. A new tool has been put together to simplify the work of creating templates, as a package of emacs functions and (textual) templates. With the emacs-ottr-toolkit, you can efficiently create and edit templates, including docTTR annotations, and test templates with example data. The tool also simplifies the use of Lutra to check for errors and generate documentation, reducing the effort needed to get template libraries published. A short walk-through of how the tool is used will demonstrate how this works.

It was very impressive to see the pinephone rotate near instantly, I'd bet it's faster than any android phone (it's faster than my snapdragon 855 Android).\n  As you saw, everything in doom works like in the desktop version, sone things were cropped out though, Spacemacs does better in this aspect. If this was on a faster phone and with a custom keyboard layout, it would be hands-down the best mobile editor I've used.\n  Configuration is definitely needed (I will post config soon), hopefully there will be more optimizations to make it faster and fix the choppy scrolling (pixel based scrolling)."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"02:03:56","SPEAKERS":"System Crafters","DATE":"2021-05-07T18:35:10+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bL7DPQ83c8","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"System Crafters Live!

While seemingly simple at first glance, the history of the Emacs display engine would prove to make this a much more difficult task.\n\n  In this talk I will cover the motivations and significant challenges of porting Emacs to use wayland, shed some skeletons from the code base, show the current state of the system before considering, what should be next for an editor that keeps on going.\n\n  linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it.

Using R to explore and comprehend information is just one part of this process. One usually needs a tool for code writing and interpreting at the very least and another tool for the textual side. Emacs and its Org-mode is an outlining combo that makes the whole process more consistent and more transparent in terms of scientific reproducibility. It allows every piece of research that makes up the publication to be written together in one text file. It can be compiled then and exported in one move to the format desired ‚Äì most preferably LaTeX and PDF. The benefits of using R in such context and a software toolset have been examined in the writing of a comprehensive study of the Muslim necropolis on Kom el-Dikka. The study was based on a dataset drawn from analyses of skeletal remains of over 2,500 individuals excavated to date. The data was supplemented with archaeological investigation of almost 2,000 grave units to shed light on the changes that occurred in early Islamic Alexandria.\n\n\n  Robert Mahler"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"32:24","SPEAKERS":"System Crafters","DATE":"2020-10-29T04:50:25+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCCIudu53Zg&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Tips - How to Create Your Own Color Theme","DESCRIPTION":"In this video, we'll learn how to use the Autothemer package to create a custom color theme for Emacs!\n\n  The theme source code for this video can be found here: https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/blob/master/hallo-theme.el\n\n  My Emacs configuration: https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles/blob/master/Emacs.org\n\n  If you enjoy this series, please consider becoming a GitHub Sponsor: https://github.com/sponsors/daviwil\n\n  Follow me on Twitter for more Emacs content!\n  https://twitter.com/SystemCrafters\n\n  Join the System Crafters community on Discord: https://discord.gg/yVD8Gx6\n\n  Intro music: Coriolis Effect by logos feat. stefsax, licensed CC-BY\n  http://ccmixter.org/files/mseq/26296"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"04:33","SPEAKERS":"Zaiste Programming","DATE":"2020-10-28T19:58:45+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH3ZH95zjKM&list=PLhXZp00uXBk4np17N39WvB80zgxlZfVwj&index=24&pp=iAQB","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":org:","TAGS":":org:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Org Roam Setup ¬∑ Emacs Doomcasts 25","DESCRIPTION":"Org Roam is a tool for organizing notes in Emacs built on top of Org Mode. It‚Äôs a replica of Roam Research, a web based tool that popularized this approach of organizing notes not in a hierarchical way, but as set of documents connected with links. Somehow similar to how the Web is organized. You write a note, then another and maybe you connected them with links if they are related. The key idea in Roam and in Org Roam is that for each note you can see on the side other notes that mention or reference the note you are currently viewing. By seeing the relations between your notes, you have more context about the information you are storing in them. It‚Äôs very simple, yet powerful. Finally, contrary to Roam Research, by using Emacs, you write notes as plain text. You can store them anywhere. And you are not locked-in to a particular vendor.\n\n  * Capture a new note: `SPC n r c`\n  * Add a link to a note: `SPC n r I`\n  * See the backlinks: `SPC n r r`\n\n  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.\n\n  If you liked this video (or any of the previous ones), please, consider supporting my efforts via GitHub Sponsors\n  https://github.com/sponsors/zaiste\n\n  Your sponsorship will help me make even better videos & release them more often. ;)\n\n  Join the Discord channel for discussions: https://discord.gg/eK6HjjG\n\n  #emacs #orgroam #emacsdoom"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"17:28","SPEAKERS":"DistroTube","DATE":"2020-10-25T22:58:01+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey54ovJUdQ4&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Font And Line Settings In Doom Emacs","DESCRIPTION":"I am going to cover a few parts of my Doom Emacs config.

Often, when people discover Org-Mode, they start wanting to rewrite all of their configs as literate configs in Org.\n\n  ERRATA:\n  I mentioned in the video that this would work on any config file written in an actual programming language.  That 's not actually the case. Tangle will work on anything, so it doesn't have to be a programming language, since we are not really evaluating the code with this.  We are just writing what's in the SRC blocks to the file we specify.\n\n  NOTE:\n  I did all of this on a live stream earlier today but the stream had some buffering issues.  I thought this topic was too important not to go back and  re-record.

You can use SPC g g to initiate the status page. Most Git commands are done from this status page. The status page provides comprehensive information about the current context changes. You can easily see files diffs and selectively stage parts of a file.\n\n  In this episode we learn how to merge pull requests directly from Emacs using Magit and the Forge package.\n\n  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.\n\n  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.\n\n  If you liked this video (or any of the previous ones), please, consider supporting my efforts via GitHub Sponsors\n  https://github.com/sponsors/zaiste\n\n  Your sponsorship will help me make even better videos & release them more often. ;)\n\n  Join the Discord channel for discussions: https://discord.gg/eK6HjjG\n\n  #emacs #magit #git"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"17:26","SPEAKERS":"DistroTube","DATE":"2020-06-27T22:38:34+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MquoGuU8sHM&list=PL5--8gKSku15uYCnmxWPO17Dq6hVabAB4&index=46&pp=iAQB","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":exwm:","TAGS":":exwm:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Turn Emacs Into A Window Manager With EXWM","DESCRIPTION":"Emacs isn't a text editor.

Whether they consider themselves to be a ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù or not, it isn‚Äôt long before this amazement gives way to strong feelings of empowerment upon realizing that it only takes a few keystrokes to begin studying and improving any part of the Emacs source code. But rather than being something unique to Emacs or just a part of working in a Lisp-based editor, GNU Emacs‚Äô ability to empower its users has as much to do with *GNU* as it has to do with Emacs.\n\n  Emacs is a flagship program of the GNU Project in more ways than one: for not only is it a successful and communally developed free software project, it‚Äôs also perhaps the one closest to the original vision of the GNU system ‚Äì a full computing environment centered around user freedom and empowerment. Emacs did not get to where it is today because of its technical excellence alone. Rather, the success of Emacs is inseparable from its being free software. The great proliferation of communally shared packages, modes, and extensions is not a *quirk* of Emacs, but instead a vision of what the average computing experience could be in a world that had as its chief focus a respect for its users‚Äô freedom. As lovers of Emacs, what can we do to work towards this future, and bring the joy of computing back to all? With this talk I hope to explore the ethical values that led Emacs to its current position, and point to ways that we can help further its wild and messy, but enduring and egalitarian spirit.\n\n  Notes from pad:\n    ‚Ä¢ Campaigns Manager at FSF (https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board/)\n    ‚Ä¢ Q&A\n      ‚Ä¢ How to introduce total non-information savy users to Emacs?\n      ‚Ä¢ [‚Ä¶]\n      ‚Ä¢ Contributing for documentation is very good as well.\n\n    related:\n    ‚Ä¢ https://karl-voit.at/2017/02/10/evolution-of-systems/\n    ‚Ä¢ Quote from https://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.en.html\n      ‚Ä¢ \"It was Bernie Greenberg, who discovered that it was (2). He wrote a version of Emacs in Multics MacLisp, and he wrote his commands in MacLisp in a straightforward fashion. The editor itself was written entirely in Lisp. Multics Emacs proved to be a great success ‚Äî programming new editing commands was so convenient that even the secretaries in his office started learning how to use it. They used a manual someone had written which showed how to extend Emacs, but didn't say it was a programming. So the secretaries, who believed they couldn't do programming, weren't scared off. They read the manual, discovered they could do useful things and they learned to program.\""},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"07:38","SPEAKERS":"EmacsConf and Emacs hangouts","DATE":"2019-11-25T02:50:08+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKbJ2UyeU3o","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"EmacsConf 2019 - 25 - Closing remarks - Amin Bandali","DESCRIPTION":"You can watch this video with free software at: https://media.emacsconf.org/2019/25.html\n  Download (720p): https://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/emacsconf/2019/emacsconf-2019-25-closing-remarks--bandali.webm\n\n  Notes from pad:\n    ‚Ä¢ done at this point so that nobody is missing it due to overtime\n    ‚Ä¢ stay tuned for the next pre-recorded videos!"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"09:20","SPEAKERS":"EmacsConf and Emacs hangouts","DATE":"2019-11-25T02:48:33+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8khKKD0NoF8","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"EmacsConf 2019 - 23b - Interactive Remote Debugging and Development with TRAMP Mode - Matt Ray","DESCRIPTION":"You can watch this video with free software at: https://media.emacsconf.org/2019/23.html\n  Download (1080p): https://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/emacsconf/2019/emacsconf-2019-23-interactive-remote-debugging-development-with-tramp-mode--mattray.webm\n  Download (720p, live Q&A): https://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/emacsconf/2019/emacsconf-2019-23-interactive-remote-debugging-development-with-tramp-mode--questions--mattray.webm\n  Slides and notes: https://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/emacsconf/2019/emacsconf-2019-23-interactive-remote-debugging-development-with-tramp-mode--slides-notes--mattray.pdf\n\n  Notes from pad:\n    ‚Ä¢ https://github.com/mattray/emacsconf2019\n    ‚Ä¢ https://MattRay.dev\n    ‚Ä¢ https://github.com/mattray/home-directory/\n    ‚Ä¢ https://www.softwaredefinedtalk.com/\n    ‚Ä¢ https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Mode.html\n    ‚Ä¢ [tramp mode] (https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode)\n      ‚Ä¢ https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/\n    ‚Ä¢ testing infrastructure: \"Test Kitchen\"\n      ‚Ä¢ https://kitchen.ci\n    ‚Ä¢ [Vagrant] (https://vagrantup.com)\n    ‚Ä¢ [Chef] (https://Chef.io)\n    ‚Ä¢ [InSpec] (https://inspec.io)\n    ‚Ä¢ pry\n      ‚Ä¢ Ruby interactive debugger\n      ‚Ä¢ http://pryrepl.org/\n    ‚Ä¢ Q&A\n      ‚Ä¢ using multiple ssh sessions\n      ‚Ä¢ he is using `nohup' to get it to background\n      ‚Ä¢ relocating is not a requirement for Matt (tmux advantage)\n      ‚Ä¢ What are the main advantages on using shell within Emacs in contrast to terminal/(ssh/)tmux/zsh directly?

While Perl and Ruby have often sparred for that position, for me, the Shell has always been that comfortable old shoe to get things done. At least, until a few years ago when I realize that since I‚Äôm always in Emacs, why shouldn‚Äôt I just write my transient helper scripts in Lisp?\n\n  Didn‚Äôt take long to realize why I didn‚Äôt jump on that idea earlier. It isn‚Äôt very scripty. However, Lisp is moldable, and it doesn‚Äôt take much to become the scripting language of your dreams.\n\n  But I‚Äôm not talking about some fancy new functions, I also have to talk about the required paradigm shift: From invisibly piping text from executable to executable, to visibly transforming a buffer with calls to multiple functions. So let‚Äôs change our workflow from script arguments with completion to function calls with completing read from Helm/Ivy. I daresay, this workflow can be much better.\n\n  Notes from pad:\n    ‚Ä¢ @howardabrams http://www.howardism.org\n    ‚Ä¢ love/hate-relationship with the shell\n      ‚Ä¢ https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm\n    ‚Ä¢ interactive vs. scripts\n    ‚Ä¢ demo: [Piper] (https://gitlab.com/howardabrams/emacs-piper)\n    ‚Ä¢ scripts\n    ‚Ä¢ (video outage for 5 minutes approximately)\n    ‚Ä¢ Q&A\n      ‚Ä¢ sharing workflow with non-emacs persons: no, mostly for himself in private life\n      ‚Ä¢ (further video issues; audio worked)\n      ‚Ä¢ working with huge buffers\n      ‚Ä¢ how does piper work for you on large files (10k lines or so?)\n        ‚Ä¢ haven't checked\n      ‚Ä¢ is the key to thinking about the workflow is to convert stuff to buffer and operating on it?\n        ‚Ä¢ the emacs/lisp way of doing things\n      ‚Ä¢ Name suggestion: husk\n\n    related:\n    ‚Ä¢ https://github.com/howardabrams\n    ‚Ä¢ https://github.com/junegunn/fzf\n    ‚Ä¢ https://docs.racket-lang.org/rash/index.html\n    ‚Ä¢ https://gitlab.com/howardabrams/emacs-piper\n    ‚Ä¢ (was he mentioning that?)

The problem with most applications, outside Emacs, is that people try and guess how a blind user for example would use their package/application.

Magit aims to improve upon Git commands in order to make simple things faster and complicated things simple.\n\n  Magit is already included and configured in Emacs Doom. You can use SPC g g to initiate the status page. Most Git commands are done from this status page. The status page provides comprehensive information about the current context changes. You can easily see files diffs and selectively stage parts of a file.\n\n  In this episode we learn how to combine Magit with the Forge package in order to be able to issue pull requests directly from Emacs. Using the create pull requests command we specify one of our branches as the base for this pull request. Once submitted, the pull request appears on GitHub.\n\n  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.\n\n  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.\n\n  #emacs #emacsdoom #magit"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"13:11","SPEAKERS":"BTH/msv","DATE":"2019-11-08T10:39:44+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://youtu.be/5ViUBaarsbw","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"GANTT chart in Emacs","DESCRIPTION":"On popular demand, here is the gnuplot code (essentially copied from the gnuplot example at: http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_5.1/gantt.html\n\n  #+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot :var DATA=gantt-table :file gantt-out.png\n  OneMonth = strptime(\"%m\",\"2\")\n  timeformat = \"%Y-%m-%d\"\n  T(N) = timecolumn(N,timeformat)\n\n  set xdata time\n  set format x \"%b\\n'%y\"\n  set xtics OneMonth nomirror\n  set xtics scale 2, 0.5\n  set mxtics 4\n\n  skiptorow=4\n  set yrange [(skiptorow-2):] reverse\n  set ytics nomirror\n\n  unset key\n  set title \"{/=15 GANTT Chart Example}\"\n  set grid x y\n  set border 3\n  set style arrow 1 nohead filled size screen 0.02, 15 fixed lt 3 lw 8\n\n  plot DATA using (T(3)) : ($0) : (T(4)-T(3)) : (0.0) : yticlabel(1) with vector as 1\n  #+END_SRC"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:48:20","SPEAKERS":"GeekNight ThoughtWorks","DATE":"2019-11-06T15:17:20+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9i2wcCfzU&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":org:literate:","TAGS":":org:literate:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Literate Programming with Emacs Org-mode","DESCRIPTION":""},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:48:20","SPEAKERS":"GeekNight ThoughtWorks","DATE":"2019-11-06T15:17:20+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9i2wcCfzU&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":org:literate:","TAGS":":org:literate:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Literate Programming with Emacs Org-mode","DESCRIPTION":"Literate Programming is about creating narratives.

This turns programming into a conversation between programmers and their compilers, where Emacs acts as an intermediary. However, programmers are limited in the kinds of questions they can ask. Recent work on extensible editor actions leverages metaprogramming techniques to specify how the compiler should answer custom questions, but that requires writing code in Emacs Lisp to glue the compiler and the editor interface because metaprograms can only command the compiler and not the editor itself.\n\n  In this talk, I will describe editor metaprogramming, a novel idea of writing metaprograms that command the editor. I define a monadic embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) for editor commands in Coq, which enables composing these commands in meaningful ways, with the full power of Coq! I will write an interpreter for this eDSL in Emacs Lisp, and make Emacs and Coq processes communicate back and forth. Coq computations will be sent back to Coq, and effectful editor actions such as deleting a character and moving the cursor will be executed in Emacs Lisp.\n\n  Presenter: Joomy Korkut\n  Presented at the Scheme workshop 2019: https://icfp19.sigplan.org/home/scheme-2019, part of ICFP'19: icfp19.sigplan.org"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"08:30","SPEAKERS":"Protesilaos Stavrou","DATE":"2019-10-16T14:04:15+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5v2iB1FqFw&list=PL8Bwba5vnQK14z96Gil86pLMDO2GnOhQ6&index=104&pp=iAQB","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs: transpose text","DESCRIPTION":"Demo of some cool and useful things you can do with Emacs' various \"transpose\" commands.

Growing up and attending college in Calgary, Alberta, Gosling began his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University in 1977, finishing in 1983. While at CMU, Gosling developed the first Unix version of Emacs, learned about byte codes while porting PERQ software to VAX, and developed the Andrew window system. After a brief stint at IBM working on a RISC computer, Gosling joined Sun in 1984, and created the NeWS window system. After NeWS lost to X Windows in the marketplace, a group including Gosling formed the Green project at the end of 1990 to explore consumer technologies, producing the Star7, a multimedia remote control. It was for Star7 that Gosling first created the Oak language, later renamed Java. After a brief spin-out from Sun as the company FirstPerson and an unsuccessful foray into interactive cable TV, Gosling‚Äôs team repurposed Java for the Web in 1994, which enabled dynamic and interactive web pages at a time when most were static. Sun partnered with Netscape to include Java with the Navigator browser in 1995. Sun‚Äôs goal was for Java to become a network-centric, platform-independent platform that would free computers from proprietary systems like Microsoft. While Java is less popular than other languages on PCs and web browsers, it has become the dominant language in enterprise computing, and a major player in mobile and embedded computing.\n\n  * Note:  Transcripts represent what was said in the interview.

Checkboxes in Org Mode start with square brackets. They are used to split a task into a number of simple steps, or to create a checklist.\n\n  Checkboxes can be nested. In that case, the parent checkbox tracks the progress of its children. Additionally, there are markers to display the count, either as a number or as a percentage. These are called cookies in Org Mode. Those cookies must be attached to the parent element, either headline or another checkbox.\n\n  Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.\n\n  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.\n\n  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.\n\n  Zaiste Weekly Newsletter: https://bit.ly/zaiste-weekly\n\n  #emacs #emacsdoom #orgmode"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"05:22","SPEAKERS":"Joshua Hoeflich","DATE":"2019-09-16T02:09:44+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://youtu.be/v4ZBudA6vpY","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Your Mac Comes With Tetris - An Introduction to Emacs and the Terminal","DESCRIPTION":"Did you know that your Mac comes with Tetris?

In other words, you choose the place that you want the cursor to be and with a search for a word followed by a label selection, you quickly jump there.

You can do it vim style ( :e filepath ) or if you try to visit a non existing file in the SPC f f menu it'll create a new file for you.\n\n  Emacs installation in ...\n  Ubuntu: https://bit.ly/2UXsAr4\n  Mac OS: https://bit.ly/2GOcNCi\n  Windows: https://bit.ly/2PAlqmF\n\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/safijari\n\n  Laser Groove Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\n  Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\n  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n  Thumbnail from: https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/08/30/introduction-to-spacemacs/"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"16:03","SPEAKERS":"Rainer K√∂nig","DATE":"2019-04-27T12:51:30+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be8TC-i-NpE","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":org:","TAGS":":org:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Orgmode-TV: How do I plan my days","DESCRIPTION":"This video shows how I am doing my daily plans.\n\n  The \"magic\" for the F5 key is described in my blog here:\n  https://koenig-haunstetten.de/2018/02/17/improving-my-orgmode-workflow/\n\n  The stuff with \"org-focus-free\" is described in this blog article:\n  https://koenig-haunstetten.de/2019/01/06/changes-to-my-orgmode-system/\n\n  Hope you enjoy this video and it makes understanding the planning process easier."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"Piotr Kaznowski","VIMEO_URL":"https://vimeo.com/331893368","DURATION":"1:04","DATE":"2019-04-23T00:46:53+00:00","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs package: go importer","DESCRIPTION":"Emacs package supporting go-mode: takes care of import declaration on fly.\n\n  https://gitlab.com/caseneuve/go-importer"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"52:43","SPEAKERS":"ColeWunderlich","DATE":"2019-04-15T22:33:24+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgyRdnjRI4o","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Org-mode: Organizing a Scientist's Life and Work by Prof. Carsten Dominik","DESCRIPTION":"A step-by-step talk from Dr. Carsten Dominik on how to use Org-mode to organize one's life as a scientist.\n\n  Org-mode combines many organizational tasks into one application including an expandable outliner, a to-do system, note taking, code documentation and execution, and document creation.  This effectively encompasses the functionality of workflowy, OneNote/Evernote,  jupyter/ipython notebooks, and your favorite to-do app all in one place.\n\n  If you are interesting in trying org-mode you can get installation instructions here: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html#orgb836ac0\n\n  Or visit the main page here: https://orgmode.org\n\n  Note: Org-mode is an application or 'mode' in Emacs. I personally recommend using Spacemacs to run Org-mode as it is more user friendly than stock emacs.  To avoid confusion, select emacs mode when setting up spacemacs.\n\n  Main Site: http://spacemacs.org/#\n  Installation Instructions: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs#prerequisites\n  Fixing A Known Bug: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/9603#issuecomment-435283494\n\n\n  This video has been re-uploaded as it is no longer directly available from it's original source.\n\n  Original Source: http://www.nf.mpg.de/orgmode/guest-talk-dominik.html\n\n  Archived Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20150324042308/http://www.nf.mpg.de/orgmode/guest-talk-dominik.html"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"16:25","SPEAKERS":"EmacsCast","DATE":"2019-04-15T13:52:05+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTOhosGQ2f0","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"My Emacs Workflow: projects, navigation, editing","DESCRIPTION":"My config ‚Üí https://github.com/freetonik/emacs-dotfiles\n  Castlemacs (based on my config, but richer and more user friendly) ‚Üí https://github.com/freetonik/castlemacs\n\n  Podcast about emacs ‚Üí https://emacscast.org/"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"16:18","SPEAKERS":"GDQuest","DATE":"2019-04-13T17:00:06+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCNOB5jjtmc&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Installing and getting started with Spacemacs: Emacs tutorial","DESCRIPTION":""},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"16:18","SPEAKERS":"GDQuest","DATE":"2019-04-13T17:00:06+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCNOB5jjtmc&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Installing and getting started with Spacemacs: Emacs tutorial","DESCRIPTION":"Learn to install Spacemacs, a crowdsourced and complete Emacs configuration, find and edit the configuration file, and get rolling releases.\n\n  Install Emacs: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\n  Get Spacemacs: http://spacemacs.org/\n  Get git: https://git-scm.com/\n  Learn git: http://try.github.io/ to get started, https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git to go further with an interactive tutorial\n\n  Org Mode tutorial: https://youtu.be/PVsSOmUB7ic\n\n  Get our game creation courses: https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/courses\n\n  Discord ‚ñ∫ https://discord.gg/87NNb3Z\n  Twitter ‚ñ∫ https://twitter.com/nathangdquest\n\n  This video is licensed under the CC-By 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n  You can attribute it to \"GDQuest and contributors - https://www.gdquest.com/\""},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"11:56","SPEAKERS":"MAKC","DATE":"2019-04-12T17:00:02+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8hCXU99tIY","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Let‚Äôs Code // 202 // Emacs","DESCRIPTION":"Thanks for watching!!!üëå\n\n  Sign up for PureVPN (Affilliate)\n  https://billing.purevpn.com/aff.php?aff=45568\n\n  We sure to follow the link below and keep an eye on the series playlist:\n  Series Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIYVhRocqRoT6yvieIyNehUz6VnB6hXhF\n\n  To Install Homebrew\n  /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\n  To Install Emacs\n  brew install emacs ‚Äîwith-cocoa\n\n  Homebrew: https://brew.sh\n  Emacs App: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\n  Emacs Keyboard Shortcuts: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_keys_basics.html\n\n  To start off the new series, I thought it would be a good idea to go on a quest to find the best text editor to use for our web design.

This provides, amongst other things, a near-identical replication of vim within emacs. Seasoned vim users can access unparalleled configurability and extendability of emacs, without the need to learn new keybindings for editing. The configuration is designed to make emacs easily discoverable and make common configurations simple. Vanilla emacs users can have the convenience of simple modular configuration, whilst taking advantage of a powerful modular configuration and switching between vim and emacs style with a single keystroke."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"05:55","SPEAKERS":"Undo","DATE":"2018-05-03T10:41:46+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stqWXsTK1qU","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"How to use UDB (previously UndoDB) with Emacs","DESCRIPTION":"This video shows some of the functionalities provided by UDB when using the Emacs IDE.\n  UndoDB is the interactive reverse debugger for Linux-based applications.

Of course there is a lot more you can do with Emacs, but much like playing an instrument, great skill only comes with practice.\n\n  You neither need to be an Emacs user nor a Clojure programmer and neither do you need to contemplate about becoming one either to enjoy this talk. Much like you don't become a professional musician by attending a concert, but it might very well be inspiring.\n\n  This talk was recorded at the Clojure Meetup in Zurich, Switzerland (organised by 200ok.ch).\n\n  Please find the slides here: http://200ok.ch/posts/2018-04-27_Play_Emacs_like_an_Instrument.html\n\n\n  If you enjoy this channel, please consider becoming a GitHub Sponsor: https://github.com/sponsors/200ok-ch/"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"11:52","SPEAKERS":"Mike Zamansky","DATE":"2018-04-22T21:37:29+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sFTkCQ774o&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Using Emacs 48 - silversearcher","DESCRIPTION":"Blog post: http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-48-siversearcher\n\n  Series page: http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs\n\n  Emacs config: https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"Joseph Wilk","VIMEO_URL":"https://vimeo.com/265189088","DURATION":"0:29","DATE":"2018-04-17T13:39:53+00:00","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":music:multimedia:","TAGS":":music:multimedia:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Scratching Samples with Emacs","DESCRIPTION":"Controlling head playback position via the cursor position in Emacs."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"Joseph Wilk","VIMEO_URL":"https://vimeo.com/265188142","DURATION":"1:40","DATE":"2018-04-17T13:35:27+00:00","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":music:","TAGS":":music:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Controlling Synths live in Emacs","DESCRIPTION":"Sending midi control data to a live running synth through Emacs.

Luckily they are all pretty simple. In fact, you can just... install them and copy/paste some stuff and be on your way! I wanted to understand these emacs packages though, and that's a little more challenging.\n\n  Ivy is a package that helps you search. It helps you do things in M-x, or find file, and Dired, etc... Anything where you look for something in Emacs, Ivy can come to the rescue and help you type less.\n\n  For example. Let's say I want to look through some Melpa packages. No longer do I have to type package-list-packages.  Instead, I can just type \"pa li packa\"  and Ivy will find all the results that match the search terms. Using spaces, you can target certain parts of what you're looking for. It just helps you type less.\n\n  Ivy doesn't rely on anything, but Swiper will automatically pull in Ivy when it's installed, because Swiper needs Ivy. Swiper does the same thing as Ivy, but replaces isearch, so you can use ivy features when searching through text.\n\n  Counsel gives you extra functions that aren't normally available. For example: You can open a buffer or file in a new window.\n\n  These packages integrate with a LOT of other emacs packages, so it's really"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:33","SPEAKERS":"Arne","DATE":"2017-08-13T22:13:41+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7n0IdWOsFI","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"checking publications with emacs","DESCRIPTION":"Emacs with helpers (challenge: do you spot the error?):\n\n  - M-x local-set-key\n    - c: bab/w3m-copy-url-at-point\n    - b: imksun/jump-to-bibtex\n\n  Using the functions:\n\n  (setq imksun/bib-basepath \"/home/arne/imksun-REFERENCES-ARCHIV/\")\n\n  (require 'thingatpt)\n\n  (defun imksun/jump-to-bibtex (biburl)\n    \"Jump to the bibtex file which fits a given biburl from the\n  imk-asf-sat MIPAS papers list\"\n    (interactive (list\n                  (read-string (format \"Bibtex-Url (%s): \" (or\n                                 (w3m-anchor) (thing-at-point 'url)))\n    nil nil (or (w3m-anchor) (thing-at-point\n                              'url)))))\n    (print biburl)\n    (let* ((bibkey (string-replace\n                    \"http://www.imk-asf.kit.edu/downloads/sat/\" \"\" (string-replace\n                    \"https://www.imk-asf.kit.edu/downloads/sat/\" \"\" biburl)))\n           (firstletter (string (downcase (string-to-char bibkey))))\n           (bibpath (concat imksun/bib-basepath \"ref_\" firstletter \".bib\")))\n      (find-file-other-window bibpath)\n      (goto-char (point-min))\n      (search-forward bibkey)))\n\n  (defun bab/w3m-copy-url-at-point ()\n    \"Jump to the bibtex file which fits a given biburl from the\n  imk-asf-sat MIPAS papers list\"\n    (interactive)\n    (let ((url-at-point (or (w3m-anchor) (thing-at-point 'url))))\n      (kill-new url-at-point)))\n\n  Recorded with recordmydesktop and key-mon."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"08:35","SPEAKERS":"Seeker Labs","DATE":"2017-08-09T23:57:21+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3th2jyv35c","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Super Fast Frame/Window Switching with FrameMove & WindMove","DESCRIPTION":"https://truthseekers.io/lessons/an-introduction-to-emacs-everything-you-need-to-know-to-get-started/\n\n  0:20 - Windmove with Arrows\n  1:51 - FrameMove with Arrows\n  3:55 - Hook FrameMove & WindMove together\n  6:00 - Move with VIM bindings!!\n\n\n\n  In this video you'll learn how to quickly switch between Windows and Frames using the packages \"FrameMove\" and \"WindMove\".\n\n  The problem with the default Emacs configuration is that switching between frames and windows is slow and inefficient.\n\n  Switching to a new Emacs Frame by default uses the command C-x 5 0,  and switching between windows is C-x o, and when you use C-x o you have to go through a loop.\n\n  By using Windmove and framemove you can setup intuitive and efficient keybindings to quickly move between windows and frames.\n\n  Most people setup windmove and framemove to cycle between windows using the arrow keys along with a modifier key like \"Shift\". This is a significant improvement upon the default because you can switch between emacs windows & frames using the arrow keys.\n\n  Instead of being limited to forward and backward, you can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT, which can dramatically improve your speed.\n\n  Unfortunately, the arrow keys are too far away. Any good programmer will keep his or her hands on the keyboard as much as possible, and not waste their time reaching for the arrow keys unless necessary.\n\n  Luckily, there's a simple improvement to allow you to switch between Emacs windows and frames even quicker.  By editing your .emacs configuration, you can adjust the windmove and framemove shortcuts to be bound to the keys \"H\", \"J\", \"K\", and \"L\".\n\n  If you look closely, you'll notice those keys are right under your fingers when you're typing, so it's much easier and faster to move between frames and windows!"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"04:01","SPEAKERS":"Seorenn","DATE":"2017-08-08T04:44:17+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8jYiK2QPoM&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":spacemacs:","TAGS":":spacemacs:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Spacemacs #1 Installation / Troubleshooting / How to quit | ÏÑ§ÏπòÌïòÍ≥† (ÏÑ§ÏπòÏóêÎü¨ÎèÑ Í≤™Ïñ¥Î≥¥Í≥†) Ï¢ÖÎ£åÌï¥Î≥¥Í∏∞","DESCRIPTION":"Spacemacs: How to install?

Usually they are generated with scripts (either .py or.ipynb`), and a natural way of maintaining these scripts is using either a long script file or multiple short files.\n\n  When one has to update these outputs, the usual workflow is: 1) find the file(s) and code block(s) inside the file that contains the code for output generation, 2) re-learn what you did so you can edit the code, and 3) run the code to generate new outputs.\n\n  Each of these steps has a cognitive overhead (non-fluency), which hampers your productivity, especially if it has been a while since you looked at them. Using IPython Notebook facilitates some of the procedures but it does not solve everything.\n\n  In this talk, I introduce org-mode and some of its functionalities for all three steps. org-mode is ideal for managing these tasks because it can minimize the non-fluency. It has a convenient and flexible markup syntax for hierarchical documents. It uses tree-like headlines, which make it very easy to organize code and text. It provides a convenient way to collapse or expand headline blocks and navigate through them. In addition, one can execute a code block or export the results (or the source code itself) conveniently inside org-mode. Theoretically, one can have the entire contents and code for a paper and a presentation inside one org file. I show examples of how one can leverage these functionalities to maintain outputs."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"3:53","SPEAKERS":"John Kitchin","DATE":"2015-10-09T08:51:40-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0s3PDBqsEc","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":org:latex:","TAGS":":org:latex:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Using the cursor to toggle LaTeX overlays in org-mode","DESCRIPTION":"We explore using the cursor to toggle the image overlays on LaTeX equations in org-mode."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:01:06","SPEAKERS":"thoughtbot","DATE":"2015-10-07T15:30:00+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtieBc3KptU&pp=ygUFZW1hY3M%3D","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":writing:","TAGS":":writing:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs For Writers","DESCRIPTION":"Jay Dixit is a science writer whose work has appeared in The New York Times, Rolling Stone, and Psychology Today.

On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\n  About the talk:\n  The term \"programming language\" is often used to describe the medium we use to build software. However, to what extent can we also consider programming languages as interfaces in their own right? Are they sufficiently expressive, interactive and dynamic to, say, control a musical instrument? What if the programming language was the musical instrument? How might that challenge our perception of programming language and tools in general. For example, what happens when we consider the act of programming as a performance? What might a music programming environment which has sufficient liveness, rapid feedback and tolerance of failure look like? What benefits would such a style of programming offer business? Could live coding be beneficial for rapid prototyping, exploring big data sets, and even communicating formal business ideas?\n  Weaving Immutable Data Structures into Ephemeral Sounds - Conference Party\n\n  Armed with laptops, monomes and number of simple MIDI Kontrollers, we harness the full power of the SuperCollider synthesis engine through the incredible Overtone platform. We don't just use our laptops to tweak GUI sliders and pots, we write raw Clojure code into Emacs live in our performances. We also generate real-time visualisations perfectly synchronised to the sound with Quil and Shadertone. All the code for our sets is open source and available for you to play with: Meta-eX Ignite.\n\n  Live Hacking allows us to generate music on-the-fly enabling us to change the direction of the sound and respond to our environment at a whim. Our sounds aren't pre-recorded and tweaked on-stage, they're coded and generated live in real time. We produce a real raw noise rather than manufactured industry-polished pseudo-perfection. Our sound isn't hardcore, breakcore or speedcore - it's multi-core and fully hyper-threaded."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"Rainer Joswig","VIMEO_URL":"https://vimeo.com/83886950","DURATION":"21:20","DATE":"2014-01-10T21:49:25+00:00","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":history:","TAGS":":history:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Symbolics Document Examiner and Concordia","DESCRIPTION":""},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"Rainer Joswig","VIMEO_URL":"https://vimeo.com/83886950","DURATION":"21:20","DATE":"2014-01-10T21:49:25+00:00","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":history:","TAGS":":history:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Symbolics Document Examiner and Concordia","DESCRIPTION":"In this video I demonstrate the user interfaces of the Symbolics Document Examiner and of Symbolics Concordia.

This combination of software enables researchers to intertwine narrative and mathematical text with figures and code that is executable within a document, with capture of the output. Portions of the document can be selectively exported to LaTeX, HTML, pdf and other other formats. We have used this method to produce technical manuscripts submitted for peer review in scientific journals, in the preparation of two e-books (about 300 pages each) on using python in scientific and engineering applications (http://jkitchin.github.com/pycse), and in using python in the modeling of the properties of materials with density functional theory (http://jkitchin.github.com/dft-book), as well as a python-powered blog at http://jkitchin.github.com. Our experience suggests all three components are critical for enabling reproducible research in practice: an extensible editor, a markup language that separates text, math, data and code, and an effective language such as python.

Desperate, I tried voice recognition. At first programming with it was painfully slow but, as I couldn't type, I persevered. After several months of vocab tweaking and duct-tape coding in Python and Emacs Lisp, I had a system that enabled me to code faster and more efficiently by voice than I ever had by hand.\n\n  In a fast-paced live demo, I will create a small system using Python, plus a few other languages for good measure, and deploy it without touching the keyboard. The demo gods will make a scheduled appearance. I hope to convince you that voice recognition is no longer a crutch for the disabled or limited to plain prose. It's now a highly effective tool that could benefit all programmers."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"Chris White","VIMEO_URL":"https://vimeo.com/62072521","DURATION":"8:39","DATE":"2013-03-18T13:45:45+00:00","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":clojure:","TAGS":":clojure:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Live Clojure Setup","DESCRIPTION":"This is a quick video demonstrating how to get emacs-live setup for easy Clojure development.

From it original intend,\n   Org-mode is a system for structured note-taking and project planning.\n   It uses strictly plain text files, making it a truly portable,\n   system-independent solution. The project-planning features are\n   implemented using a fairly simple outlining paradigm, upon which\n   meta-data concepts like due dates, priorities, TODO states and tags\n   are overlayed in a non-intrusive way. Besides outlining the system\n   and its basic concepts, I will give background information into the\n   history of Org-mode and discuss the properties of such an evolved\n   system compared to a top-down designed one. Finally, I will also\n   briefly touch on some technical aspects that may be interesting for\n   Emacs wizards and developers.\n\n\n  Speaker: Carsten Dominik"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"Mark Mansour","VIMEO_URL":"https://vimeo.com/1168225","DURATION":"3:17","DATE":"2008-06-14T01:20:52+00:00","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Column Editing","DESCRIPTION":"How to edit column in Emacs"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"Reed Law","VIMEO_URL":"https://vimeo.com/1072303","DURATION":"3:11","DATE":"2008-05-27T05:19:38+00:00","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"How to make a 3D button","DESCRIPTION":"Tools used:\n  Ubuntu\n  Xara Xtreme\n  The GIMP\n  Emacs"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"00:26","SPEAKERS":"gnumarekt","DATE":"2008-05-22T14:04:51+0000","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDbi56U5qRw&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":fun:artist:drawing:","TAGS":":fun:artist:drawing:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs artist-mode","DESCRIPTION":"Emacs for Artists"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","SPEAKERS":"Stuart Halloway","VIMEO_URL":"https://vimeo.com/1013263","DURATION":"24:42","DATE":"2008-05-14T05:05:39+00:00","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":completion:","TAGS":":completion:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"What You Can Learn From ido.el","DESCRIPTION":"Rich, composable systems are the way to go--in programming languages, libraries, and interface metaphors.
