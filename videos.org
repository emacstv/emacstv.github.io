  I wish I could memorize all these keyboard shortcuts in Emacs, but I just don't use some commands often enough to build the muscle memory for them, especially since I have so many context-sensitive shortcuts thanks to Embark. That's why which-key is great. It used to be a separate package, but it's now part of Emacs 30. You just have to turn on which-key mode, and then, if you hesitate in the middle of a keyboard shortcut, Emacs will show you what you can do. It turns out that you can customize this menu,so here are some tweaks I'm trying. First, I want to change ~which-key-sort-order~ to the one that sorts by description. This groups similar functions together. Then I want to change the labels using ~which-key-replacement-alist~. Let's try it without the dashes between words. Now let's turn on multiple replacements and make things even simpler. I can even use Unicode to make it easier to spot certain commands. And of course there's an Elisp way to customize all of this. I want to see if these little tweaks can help me use Emacs better. If you use which-key, maybe you'll also want to customize your menu. Let me know what you figure out!

  In this ~21-minute video I demonstrate the new optional extension for Denote that I am developing. The 'denote-sequence.el' is part of the 'denote' package. Its purpose is to streamline the creation of "sequence notes", i.e. files that have an inherent relationship between them. The sequence is represented as a number.

  Note that the code is in-development and will be released as part of Denote version 3.2.0. I still plan to make some refinements, though the core functionality is already done.

  While apt-get and homebrew are okay to get off the ground, Emacs is increasingly uses external programs, binary native modules, and binaries for tools like tree sitter.  That situation is only going in the direction of more dependencies, not less.  When using Emacs, dependency management is just one of the tools you will command from within Emacs.  You should use tools that will give you sustainable command of all of these dependencies and access to the greatest or latest Emacs, of which there are many frequent branches with features critical to some.

  ## Demonstration of using Large Language Model (LLM) within GNU Emacs

  Prompt for Large Language Model (LLM):

  "I'm working on a program that communicates via STDIN and STDOUT. I'd like to interface with it using Emacs Lisp. Can you provide some starting points for implementing this integration?"

  Answer by the LLM (llama-3.3-70b-versatile):

  **Getting Started with Process Handling in Emacs Lisp**

  Emacs Lisp provides a robust way to interact with external
  processes. To handle a program that sends STDIN and receives STDOUT in
  Emacs Lisp, you can use the following functions and concepts:

  ### 1. Creating a Process

  * `start-process`: This function creates a new process and runs the specified program.
  * `make-process`: This function creates a new process without running a program.

  Example:
  ```elisp
  (let ((proc (start-process "my-process" "my-buffer" "my-program")))
    ...)
  ```
  ### 2. Sending Input (STDIN)

  * `process-send-string`: This function sends a string to the process as input.
  * `process-send-region`: This function sends a region of text to the process as input.

  Never anthropomorphise 🙅 the Large Language Model (LLM) 💻!

  Example:
  ```elisp
  (process-send-string proc "Hello, world!")
  ```

  ### 3. Receiving Output (STDOUT)

  * `set-process-filter`: This function sets a filter function to process the output of a process.
  * `process-filter`: This function can be used to process the output of a process.

  Example:
  ```elisp
  (set-process-filter proc (lambda (proc string) (message string)))
  ```
  ### 4. Handling Process Completion

  * `set-process-sentinel`: This function sets a sentinel function to process the completion of a process.
  * `process-sentinel`: This function can be used to process the completion of a process.

  Example:
  ```elisp
  (set-process-sentinel proc (lambda (proc event) (message "Process completed: %s" event)))
  ```
  ### Putting it All Together

  Here's a simple example of how you might handle a process that sends STDIN and receives STDOUT in Emacs Lisp:
  ```elisp
  (let ((proc (start-process "my-process" "my-buffer" "my-program")))
    (set-process-filter proc (lambda (proc string) (message string)))
    (set-process-sentinel proc (lambda (proc event) (message "Process completed: %s" event)))
    (process-send-string proc "Hello, world!"))
  ```
  Remember to replace `"my-program"` with the actual command you want to run, and `"my-buffer"` with the actual buffer where you want to display the output.

  ### Additional Tips

  * Use `with-current-buffer` to switch to the buffer where the process output is being displayed.
  * Use `insert` or `insert-and-inherit` to insert the output into the buffer.
  * Use `process-exit-status` to check the exit status of the process.
  * Use `delete-process` to delete the process when it's no longer needed.

  This is the Dynamic Knowledge Repository, inspired by Doug Engelbart's work, implemented in a PostgreSQL database, and interacted with using the text editor known as Gnu Emacs, which has programming capabilities. You can find the link in the description, download it, and try it for yourself.

  Doug Engelbart is known for his pioneering work in human-computer interaction, particularly for his invention of the computer mouse and his development of the first hypertext system.

  This is a high-level function where my program generates a daily report of my computer activities. It takes only a second.

  The feature is made possible by the fast inference provided by Groq.com and the use of large language models, which are sometimes referred to as "artificial intelligence" or AI.

  Why don't Large Language Models ever go to school? Because they already have their "LLM" degree in "artificial intelligence" from Groq.com, the fastest inference site on the web!

  I can generate text with high accuracy in nearly an instant, thanks to the integration of LLM functions directly into the editor. This allows me to access either a remote or local server as needed, making the process very convenient.

  I suggest that you learn programming; it will be useful for your life and future. There is no need to sell programs; simply learn programming and you will find uses for it later in life. It is amazing and fulfilling!

  Thank you for learning the new features of the Gnu Emacs text editor, which has a built-in programming language called Emacs Lisp (or Elisp).

  Keep learning and take care of yourself!

  Gnu Emacs is a popular, extensible, and customizable and free software text editor.

  Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that has been trained on a vast amount of text data and is capable of understanding and generating human-like language. It can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering, among others.

  Dashboard in computing is a visual representation of key information and data, usually presented in a graphical format, that is used to monitor.

  This is demonstration of running the Large Language Model (LLM) on GNU Linux computer with following configuration: old Dell motherboard with 16 gigabytes of RAM DDR3 and Nvidia Graphics Card GTX 1050 Ti with 4 GB of video RAM.

  The Large Language Model is Rocket with 3 billion parameters.

  You may find the link in the description.

  It runs very fast with the llamafile technology.

  There is GNU Emacs function specifically made for it.

  Large Language Model is also known as artificial intelligence, though there is no real intelligence built-in, in fact, it is an illusion, deceptive trick. It is understanding your words by statistics and giving you back answers by statistics.

  Though there are many practical uses for text generation, as you may see, it can edit text, generate text files, markdown markup, and help you with websites, letters, generating poems, and you name it!

  I hope that you liked this demonstration.

  Since rocket with 3 billion parameters was not so good, I am running Qwen from Alibaba with the free software license Apache 2.0 and 3 billion parameters, with the quantization level 4, K M, with quite good results.

  Run your Large Language Model locally.

  Generate text, recognize videos, generate images and speech.

  Make money in sales and marketing.

  Thanks for watching, observe details.

  You may see the model generating jokes, it may generate any kind of descriptions, summaries, and be used in creative text editing.

  Just added this one to MELPA.

  Master of Ceremonies is a new package for Emacs content creators.  It's the companion to Dslide.  I use it in basically every video I make.  Have some buffer text?  Great, now you have video content.  It's that simple.

  It's now really useful for quickly churning out images of buffer text in Emacs.  Its job is to display small excerpts of buffer text, but full frame with zero clutter.  From there, you can highlight, occlude, or remap all the faces to obtain something useful for making videos and other content.  Emacs can natively pump out SVGs, so you can use the outputs in a wide variety of roles.

  The package also has a lot of little gizmos for doing presentation.  It's all written up in the manual, so just install it and run M-x info-display-manaul RET dslide.

  I'll be going over the transient menus pretty soon to talk in-depth about how to use transient to go beyond just keymaps.  We will also discuss what MoC does behind the scenes and get a taste of Emacs display.

  This work is important.  If you can, tag my Github sponsors.  Everyone will be converted over to PrizeForge for our launch:

  In this video, I demonstrate the custom code I have to generate Org clock reports for my coaching sessions. The idea is to use the `DEADLINE` and `CLOSED` timestamps of each task to calculate their elapsed time. This way, I do not need to manually clock in to the task and then clock out of it. It is easier to not have that overhead and not to duplicate the data that is already embedded in the aforementioned timestamps.

  The code for this is available on my website here: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-12-15-emacs-org-coaching-clock

Transcript

**Introduction**

Today, I'll demonstrate a useful Emacs mode: DAP mode. This mode allows you to integrate with the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) and debug your code directly within Emacs.

**DAP Mode vs. LSP DAP Mode**

There are two main DAP modes for Emacs: the newer DAP mode and the older LSP DAP mode. DAP mode is more closely aligned with Emacs Lisp primitives, making it more flexible and powerful. However, LSP DAP mode is simpler to set up and works well with LSP servers.

**Debugging a Go Project**

To illustrate, I'll use a Go project as an example. First, I'll set a breakpoint using a custom function that highlights the line for better visibility. This function is a workaround for a known issue with breakpoint markers being hidden.

**Starting the Debugger**

I'll start the debugging session using a configuration file that specifies the debugger (dlv in this case), the program to debug, and other relevant settings. Once the debugger starts, you'll see the current scope, variables, and logs in the Emacs window.

**Interacting with the Debugger**

You can interact with the debugger using various commands:

- **Stepping:** Step over, into, or out of functions.
- **Breakpoints:** Set, clear, and condition breakpoints.
- **Variables:** Inspect variable values.
- **Expressions:** Evaluate expressions.

**Integration with LSP**

DAP mode integrates seamlessly with LSP, providing features like:

- **Code completion:** Suggest variable and function names.
- **Go-to-definition:** Jump to the definition of a symbol.
- **Hover documentation:** Display documentation for symbols.

**Debugging Tests**

To debug tests, I use a custom function that automatically sets up the debugger for the current test function. This function leverages the `go-test` library to identify the test and start the debugger with the appropriate arguments.

**Conclusion**

DAP mode is a powerful tool for debugging your code within Emacs. By leveraging its integration with LSP and other Emacs features, you can significantly improve your debugging workflow.

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FTBMyLkPFw&t=0s .

01:09 Q: When I tried comparing transducers.el to cl-lib and dash (benchmark-compiled), I got the following results
05:40 Q: Do you know of any theoretical texts on transducers?
07:04 Q: Did you think about [compiler features, macros] viz your cl, fennel, elisp, porting of your transducers?
08:16 Q: Does t-buffer-read provide a lazy stream that's linewise, or charwise, or do something else entirely?
09:09 Q: Can the Elisp library be combined with the stream.el API or seq in general?
11:47 Q: How does one debug a t-comp expression? Can you single step and see intermediate results of the different statements you declare?
14:42 Q: Is there a path for transducers to enable elisp processing of otherwise overly large datasets as if just normal Emacs \"buffers\" (i.e. just pulling one thing at a time so essentially stream-like under the hood but buffer-like in interface), with none of the usual perf issues with a traditional buffer structure?
16:51 Q: Is there an option to read a csv/json and produce an alist or plist instead of a hash table for an entry?
17:50 Q: Is the common lisp version ready for 'production' use? Is it complete enough and the API stable enough?
18:17 Q: Do we need a pre-written \"t-\" version for every already existing reducing function like + or is there a function to construct them from already defined reducer 2-arg functions?
20:26 Q: Is the compelling argument for transducers is that it's a better abstraction?

Howard Abrams (he/him)

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eEtPnTknhQ&t=0s .

02:07 Q: What's the largest code base you've ever tackled with the literate approach (esp. Emacs + Org-mode)?
03:58 Q: Have you ever used org-transclusion?
04:08 Q: What is your usage of dynamic blocks in such workflows?
04:48 Q: Is the minibuffer being deliberately hidden in this video?
05:17 Q: What's your take on Emacs+Org vs. Jupyter notebooks (for interactive programming)?
07:07 Q: Do you think any programming language is more suited to literate programming than another?
08:21 Q: Do you use inline org function calls and org babel library and such?
09:36 Q: How do you handle the cases where org markup may sometimes interfere with some of the code?
11:06 Q: You said at the start that literate didn't catch on in corporate DevOps - why not?
11:29 Q: Why not that full stack on Markdown?
12:22 Corwin's aside on orgvm
14:49 Org and Markdown fragmentation
16:17 Q: How does your management of "TODOs" (projects/tasks) interact with this literate mindset, any insightful things you do on that front?
17:30 Q: Do you LP also on larger projects?
18:38 Q: Have you used Cucumber/Gherkin/BDD and do you think it has a strong overlap to what you talked about here?
19:54 Q: What granularity are you looking for re your org files and contents, with respect to a codebase that it tangles to, or in non-coding contexts?

02:37 Q: Do you know if PGmacs works with TRAMP?
04:38 Q: How did you come up with this brilliant idea?
09:26 TRAMP continued
13:22 Q: Is sqlite-mode also capable of all of this functionality (table relations, etc)? If not, will it be possible to abstract out this functionality from pgmacs somehow?
15:06 Q: Would it be possible to move it into Emacs tree? Are the maintainers interested in it?
16:53 Q: What do you use for the in-buffer tables? Vtable?
18:16 Integrating with Emacs 30?

  The Talk I gave at EmacsConf2024:

  ========================================
  Ever thought about sharing your Emacs knowledge? Starting a YouTube channel, blog, podcast, or even smoke signals to share those tidbits? If you’ve answered "No", then I'd like to change your mind. And if you said "Yes", then you're already on the right path.

  In this talk, I will share what I've learned from my journey as an Emacs advocate, including tips, setups (both current and past), and various alternatives to get your works out there. Most importantly, I'll discuss why your story and perspective matter, even if you think otherwise. Your unique experience can inspire and help others in the Emacs community.

  About the speaker:

  Gopar, a fellow Emacs user and advocate, will be sharing insights on how everyone can become the Emacs Influencer they never knew they wanted to be.

  From starting a YouTube channel to writing blogs, Gopar will provide practical tips and share personal experiences to help you embark on your journey of sharing Emacs knowledge.

  John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

  James 1:5 - "If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you."

  I thank God for all the wisdom he has blessed me with.

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZJhMAMI7A0&t=0s .

00:16 Q: which-key was a third-party package for a long time. Is there work to bring any other popular packages into core Emacs for Emacs 31+? (magit, counsel, etc)
04:06 Q: Any way to get the goodness of Emacs for android with this other stuff?
05:15 Q: Does package-vc download a tarball from the specified git repository or clone the repository itself?
06:37 How is the new behavior of M-q in prog-mode (prog-fill-reindent-defun or something like that) different from the behavior of C-M-q (indent-pp-sexp) in older Emacs versions?
08:33 Q: Any plans for Emacs running in iOS?
09:08 Q: I am worried about the situation on non-free systems. There was talk about the Windows and the macOS versions being as good as unmaintained. Where do we go from here?
11:35 Q: Is there a best practice on what Org to use when following emacs-latest?

07:10 Q: Are there any patterns emerging, such that it would seem possible to 1) systematize 2) automate(?) the mapping of mode commands to keyboard-driven menus? Possibly even have an auto casual wrapper for an uncovered mode?
09:19 Q: Does Casual have a log where you can see what commands were invoked?
12:00 Q: Is there a setting to close menu after executing command?
14:40 Q: What modes are you working on at the moment for casual / are excited to explore?

Robin Templeton (they/them)

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjC162DnsKI&t=0s .

03:01 Q: About fibers: My understanding is that the problem with making Elisp concurrent is that none of the data structures (buffer, cons, vector, window etc) are concurrency-safe.  How do fibers help with this?
04:28 Q: Do you have a rough idea of how much of Guile is written in C?
06:19 Q: A Common Lisp implementation for Guile sounds really cool! Is there already work on this underway?
08:34 Q: Did switching from guile 2 to 3 give any performance benefits?
10:46 Q: Do you know if the Emacs maintainers are interested in switching to Guile as the engine for Emacs Lisp?
12:30 Q: Do you think guile-emacs will be able to use or (collaborate with) some of the other awesome projects around Emacs Lisp?
15:04 Q: SBCL, ...You mentioned Robert Strandh's SICL along with SBCL---does that work help with the implementation of CL in Guile?

00:00 Q: Do you have any suggestions for interactive debugging of Julia code in Emacs?
01:15 Q: Can you call out something that Julia has that Emacs does not, and which could benefit Emacs?
02:38 Q: Is there a way to use lisp syntax with Julia, like hy for python or lisp flavoured erlang?
03:51 Q: Have you tried the Julia Snail package for Emacs? It tries to be like SLY/SLIME for Common Lisp.
04:26 Q: Is there a data inspector for a Julia REPL available that you can use in Emacs?
05:24 Q: Have you tried literate programming Julia (using Org babel or some other means) in Emacs?

MetroWind (he/him)

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMzQs-pbueU&t=0s .

00:33 Q: When you choose colors based on the same lightness, does it not hurt readability since the eye sees lightness most?
01:52 Q: For monte-carlo, are all the "random" colors picked using a colorwheel/hue rotation?
02:43 Q: One area I see emacs able to do themes that is "underused?" is changing the font
08:53 Q: Have you ever kept any of the random themes that were thrown up?

01:23 Why colour?
03:04 What motivated you to learn Elisp and get into the Emacs core?
06:35 Q: Is there any intention to create a library for working with more experimental color spaces? Pulling code out of Hasliberg for this purpose, perhaps?
10:51 Q: Can we have a dark as well as light theme variations made from your theme?

04:22 Q: How good does the search work for synonyms especially if you use different languages?
05:15 Plurals
05:33 Different languages
06:40 Q: When searching by author I know authors may setup a new machine and not put the exact same information. Is this doing anything to combine those into one author?
08:50 Q: Have you thought about integrating results from using cosine similarity with a deep-learning based vector embedding?
10:01 Q: Is it possible to save/bookmark searches or search templates so they can be used again and again?
12:02 Q: You mentioned about candidate generators. Could you explain about to what the score is assigned to?
16:32 Q: easy filtering with orderless - did this or something like this help or infulce the design of psearch?

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=629ct-cBwSI&t=0s .

00:08 Q: Have you considered using CRDTs to share buffers between threads and merge any concurrent edits automatically?
01:05 Q: Why hosted on GitHub? GitHub is nonfree. Is it possible to report bugs/send patches without using GitHub?
01:22 Q: Do you think it's possible to achieve 100% compatibility with current Emacs code?
02:11 Q: so you're re-implementing elisp in rust? have you considered using a more modern lisp, such as scheme? [11:03]
04:01 Q: Do you have specific features from the Rust compiler that are missing (or are nightly-only) that you would take advantage of?
05:26 Q: Can remacs be reused?
07:23 Q: What are you thoughts on the GUI layer. Any plans on how to reimplement it?
08:21 Q: If money could fix the problem, how much would it cost to ship this with feature parity before 2026?
09:28 GObject implementation
09:56 Q: elisp is implemented in c, so if you're not implementing elisp in rust, are you using/keeping the c implementation of elisp?
10:42 Clarifying rewriting Elisp in Rust
12:57 Q: Will your Rust implementation also be able to run Emacs bytecode? Or are you implementing it at the Lisp level?
14:20 Q: Is it possible to bootstrap with just the bytecode interpreter?
17:03 What would it take to bootstrap Guile in Rune?

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLEFuDolR6Y&t=0s .

03:09 Q: I'm curious to know how the hell guile-emacs deals with all of the dynamically scoped modules out there. Is there any effort to automatically modularize and namespace stuff?
05:23 Q: Would it be possible to support a GUI toolkit other than GTK?
06:45 Q: Do you plan to provide improvements to Elisp as a language, or is the focus on a compatibility layer to facilitate doing all new extensions, etc. in Scheme?
08:29 Q: Can we consider a translator like utility to convert elisp to scheme, once guile-emacs becomes a reality?
10:54 Q: Why is being able to interpret all of \`init.el\` an useful goal?
12:08 Q: What is the plan to handle elisp packages that depend on 3rd party/external libraries? (libgit/magit or rg/ripgrep)?
15:21 Q: Not really a question, but how about Schemacs as a name?
16:45 Q: Why is it not feasible for the Emacs layer that interprets Emacs Lisp (the core in C) ot have a Scheme interpreter, instead of using Guile?

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKQcgpZS2GM&t=0s .

01:23 Q: I'd be interested how to start this journey of writing academic papers in Org-Roam when not having used Emacs Org-Mode yet? Thanks!
02:35 Q: How about connecting Emacs Org-Roam to Zotero? Is that something you have experience with?
02:55 Q: Out of curiosity, how do you manage your bibliography? Do you do it from inside Emacs, or using a separate program like Zotero?
06:22 Q: How do you start a new document?
07:41 Q: What do you think of using citar with org-roam-bibtex?
09:26 Q: Most academic journals insist that papers are formatted in their own custom LaTeX documentclass.  Does org-roam make it easy to do that?
14:21 Q: Are you using zotra or org-ref?
14:45 Q: How much of this is tied to org-roam specifically?

  In this stream, we'll try to hack the built-in Emacs Modus Themes to produce a custom theme that fits the System Crafters aesthetic.  We'll do this by tweaking a number of customization settings in the Modus Themes including the ability to apply color palette overrides.

  Is it easier to make your own custom theme or tweak the Modus Themes?  Let's find out!

  GET GOOD AT GIT:

  Have you used Git for a while but still feel like you donât really understand what youâre doing? Do you wish you understood how Git really works under the hood? Wish you knew all the cool techniques that the expert hackers use?

  In December, I'll be running a new one-day workshop called "Git Good: From Basics to Beyond in 4 Hours" that will teach you many of the secrets of expert Git users within 4 hours while giving you hands-on exercises to try it all for yourself!

  https://orgmode.org/ has a simple and effective way to fold/collapse the entirety or parts of a hierarchical document, recursively.
  - TAB cycles through the folding state of the element where the cursor is and its children.
  - SHIFT+TAB cycles through the folding state of the entire document regardless of the cursor's position.

  In this screencap, I show several operations, each with a different starting cursor position and/or starting folding state, where I hit the TAB or SHIFT+TAB keys, showing how elements get folded or unfolded recursively. I do it twice for each operation.

  When I work with video captions, I often want to split long captions using subed-split-subtitle. If my player is somewhere in the current subtitle, it'll use that timestamp. If not, it'll make a reasonable guess based on character position.

  I can use subed-word-data.el to load word-level times from WhisperX JSON or from Youtube SRV2 files. This allows me to split a subtitle using the timestamp for that word.

  Because subed-word-data colours words based on transcription confidence, I can see where something might need to be closely examined, like when there's no timing information for the words at the start or end.

  If I combine that with subed-waveform, I can see silences. Then I can tweak start times by shift-left-clicking on the waveform. This automatically adjusts the end time of the previous subtitle too.

  I like how Emacs makes it easy to use word timing data when editing captions. Yay Emacs!

  In this stream, we'll dive deeper into Emacs' built-in "completion styles", the code that determines how what you type in the minibuffer is matched against the set of all completion candidates.

  We'll experiment with the built in completion styles, try tweaking 'completion-styles-alist' to customize completion for different minibuffer commands, and also take a look at the code for some of these (including the package 'orderless') to understand how they work!

  I have never really used registers in Emacs so this will be partly a way for me to become more comfortable using them!

  Tiny overview of my personal usage of [[https://github.com/thheller/shadow-css][shadow-css]], which I like.



  Conceptually tiny:

  - Write something like =(css :p-4 :mt-2)=, =css= is a macro that just returns a classname, nothing else
  - shadow-css analyses your =clj/cljs/cljc= sources outputs .css files where the class names =your_namespace_L44=, that's it.

  This is the /clj hiccup shadow-css scittle/ stack.

  It *builds* using *babashka* only, generating *html* from *hiccup* source code,
  for *development*, you run a clj repl, optionally with a *scittle nrepl* in the *browser*, too.

  *CSS* is generated with the /tailwind-like/ *shadow-css*.

  This stack grew bottom up.

  Resources:

  - [[https://github.com/thheller/shadow-css][shadow-css]]
  - [[https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2024/10/30/supercharging-the-repl-workflow.html][Thomas Heller REPL blog post]]
  - screencast (soon)
  - [[https://github.com/benjamin-asdf/faster-than-light-memes?tab=readme-ov-file#gen-html-with-clojure-gen-css-with-shadow-css][code]]

  All build steps run with babashka, which is fast!

  -------------

  (Currently, the build duration of my blog is dominated by the emacs org html gen).

  -------------

  This would go well together with a clojure server that returns html,
  optionally with [[https://github.com/thheller/shadow-graft][shadow-graft]].

  Clojurescript and/or reagent could be added if needed.
  (Or, because scittle can do reagent).

  -------------

  It's something I would consider for small-medium projects.

  -------------

  The screencast is meant to showcase the intersection of emacs, meow, lispy, clojure, browser and repl driven development.

  I'm tweaking my video workflow. I use Orgzly Revived on my Android phone to write the text, and I use Easy Voice Recorder to record it. Syncthing automatically copies both to my laptop. I use WhisperX to transcribe my recording, and I use a little bit of Emacs Lisp to figure out timestamps for each word. I edit this to fix errors. I can even rearrange things and get rid of anything I don't want.Then I use subed-convert to turn it into a VTT file. I can tweak the start and end times by looking at the waveforms. Then I add comments with the visuals I want. I can add images, animated GIFs, or videos, and they're automatically squeezed or stretched to fit. I can also have them play at original speed. Then I set up open captions and use subed-record-compile-video. Tada!

  I use Embark to configure context-sensitive keyboard shortcuts that I can bring up with embark-act, which I've bound to "C-c .". If I pause for a moment, it'll show me which-key lists of the shortcuts. To switch to the next set of shortcuts, I can press the same shortcut again. Sometimes this list is still hard to skim. I can use C-h to select a command with completion, which is extra nice with vertico-multiform-mode and a little configuration.

  BTW, I forgot to mention that I've also built it on Arch (I tend to forget cause I broke it in 2 weeks), apart from what I already mentioned (WSL2, Debian, Fedora, Arch, OpenSuse Tumbleweed)

  I use `org-link-set-parameters` to define a lot of custom links in Org Mode for things like my blog or my Emacs config. Then I can code how I want to complete, open, and export those links. These links don't make sense to other people, of course. I want to be able to quickly copy or replace my custom links with regular web links, like the ones I use when I export to HTML.

  My shortcut for this is `C-. u` to copy the exported URL and `C-. r` to rewrite a link. These stand for `my-embark-org-copy-exported-url` and `my-embark-replace-link-with-exported-url` respectively.

  Controlling remote instruments from your ELN is a necessary feature. In this paper by Baird, S. G., & Sparks, T. D. (@TaylorSparks) (2022). What is a minimal working example for a   self-driving laboratory? Matter, 5(12), 4170–4178.  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2022.11.007 they describe a simple instrument that is remotely accessible and provide a Colab notebook to run it. In this video we control the instrument from #emacs and #orgmode and run some experiments to find conditions that come close to a desired output.

  Emacs is a fantastic UI to create notebook content, and consume (read) it. The notebook pages are in plain text though, and although GitHUB has some ability to render it in a nicer way, it isn't as nice as what is in Emacs IMO. We can convert our notebook pages to html, and host them on a remote server to make it easier for others (even including ourselves) to view the pages in a browser.  We use GitHUB pages in this example.

  Your notebook needs to be searchable in a lot of different ways; you might need to find a file, or some text, or an image, and that should be 1) possible, and 2) not that difficult. scimax comes close to this. It provides a variety of ways to search for files and in files using tools from projectile. It also provides org-db which has full-text search, image search and other org-element searches, e.g. in src-blocks.

In this video we explore writing a small report from the molecular simulation work we did in the last video. We show how to reuse data from your notebook, and a limitation of the cache system we used last time. With #scimax you can write reports and then export them to other formats like pdf using #orgmode.

We also uncover some potentially surprising features that are undesirable. Still, it is helpful to work through these so we can move towards a more complete solution later.

  I have used org-mode for over a decade now in a broad range of applications from writing papers and proposals, in research projects, task management and more. I have basically used it myself as an electronic lab notebook (ELN) of sorts. Some things about scimax make it very well-suited for this, but there are some things it is not ideal for.This video is the start of what will hopefully be a series of videos on using scimax as an ELN where I more systematically explore what it is good for, where improvements might be desired, and limitations of scimax for this purpose.

  In this first video we explore limitations of using scipy to solve a simple engineering problem.

  This tutorial focuses on Emacs's org-mode's table functionality. Tables on a surface level are simple. However, with the power of org-mode they become a spreadsheet system, time-tracking tool, programming tool, and much more.

  Small correction the reason I used :export both was for use with org export. I should have removed that from the version used in this video.

  One package I recommend checking out is https://github.com/casouri/valign if you work with lots of images and latex fragments. It does a better job at aligning the table in these cases than default emacs does.

  In this video I talk about how I use concepts from information theory to choose better keybindings for myself in emacs.

  In particular, I compute the entropy of my emacs commands, calculate a huffman encoding, and apply the theoretical optimal values to come up with better keybindings for myself.

  This is the absolutely most unhinged use of information theory you've ever seen. I show how you can use techniques from signal processing, and compression, apply them to a different domain, and succintly solve a real-world problem.

  In this ~44 minute video I demonstrate packages that upgrade the experience with Emacs. They are about the minibuffer: where we interact with Emacs to call a command by its name or pick a candidate for some action.

  The packages I cover are `vertico`, `marginalia`, `consult`, `orderless`, and `embark`. I also mention briefly the `wgrep` package as well as the built-in `savehist-mode`, `recentf-mode`.

  Since I'm planning on using Python in the near future, I thought I'd see how things have changed in terms on environment management.

  Conda lends support for anaconda / miniconda - a virtualenv replacement and then some.

  Envrc takes care of direnv support - a way to automatically set up your environment when you change into a directory.

  In this ~27 minute video, I explain how to use the built-in `abbrev-mode` to define "abbreviations" for quick-yet-powerful text expansion. I cover the most simple scenario and then go into more technical implementations: (i) to use a function instead of a predetermined text, and (ii) to expand what counts as an abbreviation so as to use characters that are not word constituents.

  creating a mpv video playlist from urls on the clipboard using wlr-which-key to run emacsclient and execute an emacs function that gets a video url from the clipboard and starts playing the video with mpv and adds additional urls to a playlist

  using the emacs mpv.el package you can control mpv from within emacs using a keyboard hydra and jump to different items in the playlist

  in this video i also cover using wlr-which-key keyboard to create keyboard shortcuts to create a queue of videos to be played using taskspooler and mpv, sending audio from youtube videos to mpd and creating a queue of videos to be downloaded

  i also look at using emacsclient to run an emacs function from your init.el on the command line or with a hot key and how to sync emacs clipboard with the system clipboard on wayland using wl-clipboard

  In this ~24 minute video I show how to define a prefix key in Emacs using built-in functionality. The idea is to organise our keys in an efficient way. Using this method, we can have nested key maps as well, meaning that the prefix key can have access to the contents of another map which holds more key bindings. Put simply, we can have "C-z" as a prefix, "C-z b" as a nested key maps for buffer-related commands, and "C-z f" for file-related commands. This is a neat way to provide quick access to our most used commands.

  Completing-read is a staple feature of Emacs where you can iteratively downselect a list of candidates by typing part of them. The matching can be literal or fuzzy, e.g. by regular expression, but it is limited to this. There is not any way to match by "meaning".

  In https://youtube.com/live/8YXc1s5-TdM I showed an example of using LLM technology to search bibtex entries by semantic similarity. Here we expand the idea, and shows some additional applications that might be interesting.

  In this ~10 minute video I show how to use Emacs to edit text in multiple languages. This is better than using the system-level keyboard layout configuration because you retain all the functionality of Emacs for key bindings (e.g. 'C-n', 'C-p', 'M-x'). In the video I demonstrate the various input methods, with prefix or postfix notation, and character composition.

  In this video I demonstrate Denote's Org dynamic blocks facility. I focus on the new 'denote-files' Org dynamic block that I am developing. In short, this new block lets you include the contents of files with the option to also add links to them as well as to omit their front matter from the block. It is a neat way to quickly consolidate your writings on a given topic.

  That’s right. Let’s take a common scenario. You’re doing some work in Emacs. Maybe you’re programming. Maybe you’re writing a novel. It doesn’t matter what you’re doing. You want to start playing some music or run a backup of your files in the background. You can open up a different app or your terminal emulator and run a command.

  What if you could run that background process from Emacs with a simple function? One and done. That’s how we like to do things in the Emacs world. The best way to get this done is to use a function called (you guessed it already), start-process.

  This stream will be recorded for future reference.  I will do some work on my Denote package and maybe tackle other Emacs-related issues.  I plan to make this about 2 hours long, though we will see in practice.

  This video is also available on my website: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-09-25-emacs-live-mostly-denote/

  ## About Denote

  Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to link between them.

  Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to "notes".  It can be used for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs, such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.

  - Package name (GNU ELPA): `denote`

  One of the problems that will occasionally crop up from time to time on Linux is the need to do a bulk rename of files/directories.  And there really aren't many simple solutions for this.  Typically, a bulk rename involves piping together a few shell commands.  But one program makes bulk renaming a breeze...EMACS!

  Emacs 29 new option package-vc-install lets you install packages from a version control sources such as github rather than having to use another package manager like straight or quelpa

  package-vc-selected-packages is a list of package installed with package-vc-install.

  package-selected-package then includes the names of package installed with package-vs-install so when you run package-upgrade-all the package installed from github are also upgraded

  The Obs Studio media source doesn't support playing youtube urls, until now i have invented a brand new method using ffmpeg named pipes that allows you to play youtube videos using the obs media source

  The new technique use a script called relay that also allows you to specify a start and end point of a youtube video to play using the sexagesimal time format.

  For example you can start playing a youtube video at 5 minutes for 30 seconds with this command

  tsp relay -i 'url' -s 00:05:00 -t 00:00:30

  the stream doesnt start until you switch to the media scene and automatically closes when you change to another scene

  You can also create a queue of youtube videos or clips from youtube videos to play, there is a version of the script called relay-local that works with local videos

  Only one scene and media source is required for this technique so instead of using 20 scenes for 20 video clips you can just use one scene

  replay script features:

  Play a whole youtube video
  Play a clip of a youtube video with a start and end time
  The stream doesnt start playing until you switch to the media scene
  The stream stops when you switch to another scene
  Create a queue a youtube videos or clips from a youtube video
  Play a local file or a clips of a local file
  Create a queue of local files of clips of local files
  Only uses one scene and one media source
  Works on the command line or using emacs

  Note:
  This technique doesnt work in Window because windows doesnt support
  named pipes, the flatpak version of obs also doesnt work because flatpak
  cant work with the system resources and use the named pipe. So you need to install the non-flatpak version of obs from your distros repo

Please look at silverbullet.md, a browser based, MIT licensed markdown notes editor that seems very in line with my personal tastes. It would be up there in the A tier.

I’ve messed with Kakoune a bit and think I’ll make a follow up about taking notes in kak (and Helix) since there were some challenges and considerations. Emacs is the best all around for notes but can be slow, Neovim is the fastest and best supported, Kakoune has interesting consistent bindings and minimalist philosophy, and Helix is snappy and kak-ish but wordier and not extensible. I could just pick one and stick with it but why not overanalyze all of them more??

  Configuring Emacs is a video series where I began with a vanilla installation of GNU Emacs and have slowly configured it.  In this video, I spend most of my time cleaning up the config file by moving a lot code to other locations.  I also add a lot of important keybindings and add some new theming options.

  mpv can take screenshots of the current playhead position in the video with the s keyboard shortcut, by default the file name of the screenshot will be mpv-shot0001.jpg

  the screenshot-template option for mpv lets you customize the screen shot file name so that it contains the video file name and the timecode with hours , minutes, seconds and milliseconds
  Big-Buck-Bunny-[00:05:30.977]v1.jpg

  this lets you see which  file the screenshot is from and the exact position in the video

  i also cover extracting a frame from a video with ffmpeg using my extract-frame script which i have updated to show the timecode in the output filename

  on the emacs side of things i look at a fix for the ob-async package error in senitel process, running org src blocks to execute ffmpeg

  extracting a frame from a video and insert the link to the image into a org file and then toggling image display on and off to view the image in emacs

  as well as other emacs and mpv settings

  The emacs mpv.el package has functions to play a url and append a url to a playlist which we can use with the eww browser

  however it requires a lot of keyboard short cuts to copy the url under the cursor, run the mpv function and paste in the url

  in this video i create a new function and keyboard shortcut to automate the whole process so we can just press the l key when the cursor is over a video link and play the video with mpv and queue up additional videos as well

  Create video playlists with Emacs dired using mpv.el with a single keyboard shortcut.

  In this video we create some functions that check the mime type of a file and if its an video or audio file open it with mpv.el but if its not we open it with emacs

  We then bind the new function to the l key so we can easily add videos or audio to a mpv playlist and control mpv from within emacs using a hydra

  the advantage over using the openwith package which use file extension and then opens them with a specific application is that if you create a text file called test.mp4 with an mp4 extension openwith would try and open it with mpv

  whereas this code checks the mime type of the file and would see the test.mp4 file its a text file and not a video, and open it with emacs and not mpv

  The emacs mpv.el package allows you to create a playlist of urls to be played by mpv, the trick is you have to run M-x mpv-play-url and the url for the first video and then M-x mpv-playlist-append-url url for the subsequent links

  In this video we will use the emacs eww web browser to view Invidious an open source front end to Youtube running in a Docker container and use the mpv video player to create a playlist of videos to play

  This doesnt create a playlist file but sends url over the mpv json rpc interface to the mpv player to play the url

  Pressing f8 in mpv will list the items in the playlist and the current position in the playlist. the greater than keyboard shortcut moves to the next playlist item and the less than keyboard shortcut moves to the previous item in the playlist

  the emacs mpv package lets you append urls to a playlist, jump to next and previous entry in the playlist, jump to a specific entry and also remove an entry from the playlist, however it only lists the urls and not the video title

  Note: I have added playlist next, playlist previous, jump to playlist entry and remove playlist entry to my hydra for controlling mpv from within Emacs

  i also cover setting up Emacs exec-path and PATH environment variable to match that used by the user's shell. This will enable auto completion for all the binaries in you shell path when you run emacs Aync Shell Command function

  these are a list of some of the commands we will be using

  shr-copy-url
  eww-copy-page-url
  mpv-play-url
  mpv-playlist-append-url

  it should be possible to create a function using the above commands so you can just press a single keyboard shortcut to copy the url and play it with mpv

  Configuring Emacs is a video series where I began with a vanilla installation of GNU Emacs and have slowly configured it into what I want.  In this fourth installment, I will create a run launcher similar to dmenu or rofi but using an Emacs window instead.  I will also setup dashboard, flycheck, company and language support for Haskell and Lua.

  Video overview of file navigation in Emacs.  There are lots of powerful commands to find files, open directories, and perform operations on the contents of the filesystem.

  In this video, I discuss Emacs' Eglot package, a language server protocol package for Emacs. With Eglot you can easily set up LSP for your language of choice. I demonstrate this with the Dart programming language showing you how to install and set up Eglot, then how to use Eglot to jump to definition, to find all references of a function, and how to rename all occurrences of a function throughout the document. I show you all "completion at point", which gives you all possible completions for an object in your programming language of choice.

  Yes, you too can keep your working files in a nice orderly condition using an archive file.  Don't rely on default, basic, archiving to the same directory.  That won't work this time.  You can use org mode to set up a custom archive file location for storing your important work in long term retrieval refrigeration.  This works nicely with org roam if you have one master node for keeping a running list of active files in play, the archive the stuff you're done with.  It's simple, with default Emacs options, find out how.  Watch.

  In this video, we discuss a package for EMACS called PERSPECTIVE. Perspective.el is a package for EMACS that allows you to have "workspaces" called perspectives so you can organize your buffers. Perspective works in a similar way that a TWM works with its workspaces. Leave me a comment down below and tell me your thoughts on perspective.

  Emacs 29 has a new command called yank-media allows you to copy an image from the clipboard and insert it into a buffer in a supported mode, the only mode currently support are message and html modes

  But with a bit of detective work i have managed to get yank-media working with org mode so you can easily add images from the clipboard as org file links

  So it's time to examine if Emacs (and org mode) are really worth the trouble of learning? They're really not so difficult when you really get down to it.  But, why bother, if you can do what you need in other programs.  In this video, I'm taking a look at some things org mode can do that (as far as I've seen) you can't do anywhere else.

  No work at home, no work for hut project, so I am doing a live stream about my `denote` package.  I want to get into unit testing with the `ert` package that is built into Emacs.  **The video will be recorded and can be watched later.**

  I have never written unit tests before.  I want to learn them as a general skill, but also because I want `denote` to have comprehensive tests in place before its next major release.

  I understand I am announcing this without much prior notice (current time 13:02 +0300).  No worries!

  ## About Denote

  Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to link between them.

  Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to "notes".  It can be used for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs, such as videos.  Naming files in a constistent way makes their filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.

If you use Dired for basic file management capabilities, this is our chance to figure out more valuable ways to use it!

  The emacs app-launcher package can open application using their desktop files either from within emacs or as a floating frame we can activate with a hotkey on wayland

  Gnomes application launcher opens a full screen grid and also zooms out your second display which is really annoying if you watching a video, so we want something a bit more minimal

  I also cover the using gnome tweaks to center new windows and change the focus mode for windows and use dconf to set keyboard shortcuts for switching workspaces.

  We also take a look at other application launchers like albert and ulauncher and the problems they have on wayland and using the wmctrl command to switch desktops on wayland and using looking glass to get the list of windows

  In this video, we're going to learn all about how org mode can provide you with unique identification codes for heading in documents. And you can use those identification codes as a constant and unbreakable link to valuable information in your file system. Turn bare org mode into a knowledge management system or create your second brain; it's your privilege and a pleasure.

  Building Emacs 30 pgtk with native comp and tree-sitter

  In this video i cover building Emacs 30 with tree-sitter installing grammars, using treesit-language-source-alist to create a list of grammars to install from github and using major-mode-remap-alist to automatically enable language grammars

  Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing
  library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and
  efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited.

  Have you updated doom-modeline in emacs and found all the icons in the modeline are now missing and replaced with a square with a broken font in them.

  emacs doom-modeline has switched from using all-the-icons to nerd-icons to display icons in the modeline so you need to install the nerd-icons package and run M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts to install the necessary fonts.

  Contenu : On va voir dans cette vidéo comment installer Doom Emacs.

  Au préalable, avant toute installation, prenez soin de faire vos sauvegardes ! Pour installer Archlinux :

  1/ Methode Endeavour os
  https://endeavouros.com/
  C'est la méthode la plus simple, celle que je recommande.

  2/ Methode Archinstall :
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall

  3/ Methode Manjaro
  (Mais attention ce n'est pas vraiment archlinux)
  https://manjaro.org/

  Et pour l'installation de Doom Emacs :

  It is raining and I have no coaching work right now...  I am thus planning to do a live stream on various Emacs topics.  The video will be recorded and can be watched later.

  There is nothing specific I want to talk about.  I will just do some general maintenance of Emacs code and go with the flow.

  A non-exhaustive list of items:

  - Write a `defalias` of `modus-themes-items` to `modus-themes-collection`.

  - Write the inverse for the `ef-themes`.

  - Document in the Modus manual how to add more spacing in the frame and between windows.

  - Solve a problem on how to get the cursor colour from the current theme (see snippet below).

    ```elisp
    ;; Getting the cursor color
    (car (alist-get 'cursor ef-duo-dark-palette))
    ;; "#ef6f11"

    ;; Getting the theme and adding the "-palette" string to match the alist
    (intern-soft (format "%s-palette"
                         (car custom-enabled-themes)))
    ;; ef-duo-dark-palette

    ;; Getting frustrated for not being able to see the error....
    (alist-get 'cursor
               (intern-soft (format "%s-palette"
                                    (car custom-enabled-themes))))
    ```

  - Contribute to the Denote mailing list thread about linking to non-note files: https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fs8b85tq.fsf%40prevos.net%3E.

  Of course, I can also do whatever else may come up during the chat.  I understand this is a short notice (I am typing this at 2023-05-06 08:01 +0300), so no worries if you can't make it.

  You are an expert at Emacs, and Emacs Lisp, which is used to script and extend Emacs. You can understand natural language requests for actions to take within Emacs, then translate them to Emacs Lisp that carries out those actions.

  Reply only in pure lisp expressions that can then be evaluated with "eval-expression". Do not include any comments or explanations. If the answer consists of multiple expressions, wrap them inside a "progn" form.

  dumb-jump lets you navigate large code bases fast and without LSP or a TAGS file. The "dumb" jumper takes the right turn most of the time. I'll show it off on #java, #c and #bash code.

  Update: The reason it couldn't find the first Java class I tried it on, ConfiguredValidator, was that this *wasn't* a class in the repo. As you can see in my second use case, the DropwizardResourceConfig class, it can successfully jump to classes in the same repository.

  In this live stream, I look at the source code for the popular text editor Emacs.

  Emacs development dates back to the 1970s and the MIT AI lab's attempt to create a hardware Lisp machine -- that is, a machine modeled more or less on the Lambda calculus. In the video, I unintentionally stumble upon a priority dispute over who actually wrote and designed the original Emacs, and I ask ChatGPT to render its judgment.

  Then, about 23 minutes in, I start digging into the code for GNU Emacs. Gnu Emacs dates back to the mid 1980s and is easily the most popular surviving Emacs implementation.

  Correction: I said I thought Steele was one of the authors of the "famous Lisp book," but that's incorrect. I was thinking of the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs," often called SICP. Steele's frequent coauthor Gerald Sussman is indeed an author of SICP, but Steele didn't work on that book. The other co-authors of SICP are Harold Abelson and Julie Sussman.

  00:00 LaTeX previews in Org Mode
  00:39 LaTeX Previews are generated in bulk, and hundreds of LaTeX fragments can be processed per second.
  01:23 Images are placed in the buffer continuously as they are generated.
  02:00 Preview generation is asynchronous and will not block Emacs.
  03:02 Previews are coloured to match surrounding text and the active theme.
  03:26 Previews automatically change colors when the active theme changes.
  04:04 Inline previews are aligned and scaled to match the font baseline and size.
  04:13 Previews scale along with text when the text scale is changed.
  04:38 Preview overlays can hide and show themselves dynamically based on cursor position.
  05:18 Org mode can auto-generate LaTeX previews as you type or edit the text of existing ones.
  06:53 Error encountered when compiling LaTeX fragments can be accessed by mousing over preview images.
  07:53 Previews are auto-generated irrespective of how they're added to the buffer.
  08:19 Org mode can keep equation numbering consistent by regenerating previews as needed.

  There is some debate within the Emacs community about whether it is "wrong" to use the Evil keybindings (the Vim bindings).  Are you using Emacs the wrong way if you go the Evil route?  Is it worth learning the Evil keybindings if you new to Emacs?  Let's discuss!

  In this video I introduce some ideas on improving literate prorgramming in Emacs and org-mode. Some aspects of literate programming are already supported in org-mode, but two features are missing: flycheck and code navigation. I will show two ways I have addressed this in scimax. They are both proofs of concept, but I think it is worth talking about them to see if there are better ideas out there for this.

  Today we will be taking a look at an Emacs feature known as the mark ring. We'll be discussing the differences between global and local marks. We'll also be covering how and when marks are added to these mark rings. In addition, we'll share some configuration recommendations to steam line the experience of using this feature.

  PLEASE NOTE:  At around : 3:10, I mention that there are two condition that's required in order to add a new mark to the global mark ring. This is actually not true, only the first condition is required. Please see the updated show notes below.

  Learn #Emacs from scratch. In this Emacs #tutorial, I'll discuss one of the most  fundamental concepts in #Elisp, Editing Modes. No matter what you are planning to do in Emacs, eventually, you will come across #major modes and #minor modes. This episode is dedicated to the basics of editing modes and in the next episode we will create a minor mode as an example.

  Next on "Emacs From Scratch, An Emacs tutorial for beginners" I will take about package management.

  Make your repetitive SEO tasks for web writing a little easier with Emacs, org mode, and a little Emacs lisp.  You can do it.  Org mode exports some random anchor link ids into your document.  You can customize these yourself with a custom properity, "custom id", but why not have org mode do it automatically.  Let's find out together.

  Substitute is a set of commands that perform text replacement (i) throughout the buffer, (ii) limited to the current definition (per `narrow-to-defun`), (iii) from point to the end of the buffer, and (iv) from point to the beginning of the buffer.

  These substitutions are meant to be as quick as possible and, as such, differ from the standard `query-replace` (which I still use).  The provided commands prompt for substitute text and perform the substitution outright.

  In the last few days, I have been playing around with creating my own "start page" for Doom Emacs.  By default, Doom comes with its own "dashboard" program but I wanted to create my own, mainly for the experience, but also because I could create a start page that was tailored exactly to my needs..

  Now you can take notes on top of other notes within your general collection of notes in Emacs in Org Mode.  We're talking pure mastery here in your "personal knowledge management" system.  (I didn't know there was such a term, but it seems to fit org mode quite well.)  But Emacs is more than that, it's also a text editor.

  The killer feature of Emacs is undoubtedly Org mode.  One of the really amazing programs that is built around Org mode is 'org-agenda', which is a scheduling application.  Org Agenda has a lot of neat configuration options to explore, so let's dive in!

  My Emacs configuration file has grown large after more than 20 years of searching for my editor nirvana. More than 1,600 lines of Lisp goodness. This Christmas, I decided to start off from scratch, only adding the lines I truly needed.

  After 3-4 days, I had around 500 lines that provided me with everything I needed: Org, XML, YAML, Java, BASH, compile buffer, Magit, nice theme and everything else.

  In this video, I go through these to me precious 500 lines of packages, tweaks, hacks and custom functions I still cannot live without.

  rip-grep on Emacs doesnt automatically switch to the results buffer,
  so you have to press C-x o to switch to the results buffer manually every time you use rip-grep

  Luckily i found an issue on the rg github issue page with some code by Howard Melman that fixes the issue and automatically switches to the rip-grep results buffer

  74. Практика использования Jquery Ajax + Django 4 в  Emacs. Полная картина взаимодействия.
  Занятие длинное 59 минут.
   Не пугайтесь, я запишу для участников короткие уроки, где Мы все продублируем, но уже быстро и коротко.

   Перед этим длинным занятием ставилась задача.
   Показать взаимодействие Ajax и Django, показать глде и что мы пишем, как связаны части Джанго, а именно представление, html файлы c Ajax JQuery.

   Так же по ходу хотел дать направление для изучение, JQuery Ajax:
            -показал как работать с документацией;
            - что бы было понятно, что Джанго это одни знания;
            - Питон это то что нам даёт понимать Джанго;
            - Что Джанго использует библитеку http и она прописана в HttpRequest классе.
            - Хотел показать, что Ajax о Джанго ничего не знает и мы прописываем селекторы.
            - Заострил внимание. а как подступиться к JQuery Ajax, показал простоту.
           -  научитесь писать  middleware (промежуточный слой), мы с вами написали функцию, которую убрали с Джанго 4 is_ajax() и сделали из неё middleware, теперь будет работать для всего проекта эта функция.

            Что бы увидели, что современный разработчик оперирует знаниями разными и здесь не нужно отчаиваться, просто берём и делаем, а потом пер осмысливаем. Если поработать с месяц с Ajax, то все получится.
            Главное, что у вас после просмотра видео будет понимание, как это используется в комплексе. А это уже даёт хорошую платформу для старта.
            Так же хотел, что бы Вы узнали о Emacs и попробовали его, обязательно получится сделать среду своей мечты, ведь это прекрасно, когда вам то одного не хватает, и вы доделываете, потом следующее и следующее и у вас появится среда, которая вас будет радовать и вы полностью откажетесь от мыши, к этому стремится любой программист.

  The basics of org mode comes down to a few things:

  Headings
  Tags
  Lists

  If you can get down these basic concepts you’re ready to move onto bigger obstacles like agenda views, capture templates, attachments, exports, babel, and much more. But start with the basics!

  Headings
  Everything in org mode starts with headings in files. You open a file (with a .org extension, and you start adding headings.

  Headings are identified by asterisks (*, or “stars”) and they are hierarchical, which means they can be nested in multiple levels.

  * Heading level 1
  ** Heading level 2
  *** Heading level 3 (and so forth)

  Headings can be rearranged in any order by holding down the Meta (or, Alt) key and using the arrows on your keyboard.

  Tags

  Tags are used to additional context to heading items.

  To add a tag, you can hover over a heading and click C-c C-c. You will be prompted to add a tag. Tab auto completion works here as well, if you want to assign an existing tag.

  Lists
  Org mode offers some powerful list-making tools. You can use dashes to start lists:

  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  - Item 3
  Then you can check boxes to these lists:

  - [ ] Take out garbage
  - [ ] Prepare tax declaration
  - [ ] Start a business
  You can check and uncheck these items with C-c C-c. (This keystroke does a lot of magical things in org mode.)

  You can also use progress indicators to see how much of the list is complete:

  - My list [/] [%]
   - [ ] Take out garbage
   - [ ] Prepare tax declaration
   - [ ] Start a business
  Watch the progress indicators move as you complete your list.

  Emacs app-launcher is a package that will launch gui application by opening their desktop entries.

  It use the xdg specification and will open application installed with the system package manager like apt, snap, flatpak and nixpkgs

  the app-launcher opens in the minibuffer and displays a list of the applications on your system with desktop entries, it doesnt display any icons next to the application but there is a open github issue request icon support from a year ago

  After you select an application to launch the app-launcher window in the mini buffer automatically hides, the app-launcher use code from the Counsel package and one of the contributors is David Wilson from @SystemCrafters

  app-launcher isnt in the melpa repo but can be installed with straight.el, use-package or by manually downloading the app-launcher.el into your ~/.config/emacs/lisp directory

  to enable the app-launcher package add the following code to your emacs init.el file

  (require 'app-launcher)

  ;; app-launcher
  (keymap-set global-map "C-c d" 'app-launcher-run-app)

  to run the app-launcher package run the following command in the minibuffer

  M-x app-launcher-run-app

  you can also bind app-launcher-run-app to a keyboard shortcut

  I demonstrate how the new theme palettes work with the "semantic colour mappings" and how to override every single entry therein. This is a flexible and powerful mechanism that gives users near complete control over the looks of the theme. As such, I am deprecating user options that produced colour variations: they were not flexible and added to the complexity of the code base.

  The new version is in development (check the `version-4` branch). I plan to merge it into `main` in the coming days and formalise the release by the end of December 2022 or the beginning of January 2023.

  Taking a look at the following emacs packages, Emacs Desktop Notification Center, vertico, marginalia, consult, embark, orderless and fd-dired

  vertico, marginalia, consult, embark, orderless can be used to replace ivy or helm as a completion framework

  consult has a nice switch to buffer function that will preview buffers before you switch to them

  orderless will let you match against any part of a sting in the mini buffer
  so instead of typing package-update-all, you can just search for update and it will match package-update-all

  fd-dired will let you search using fd which is faster than find and return the results in a dired buffer you can interact with as opposed to return fd in the terminal which will just show you a list of the files

  To install fd on ubuntu install the fd-find package

  sudo apt install fd-find

  ABSTRACT
  TALK 1: Emacs for the Win
  If there is one tool that makes me more powerful in my day-to-day life, it is Emacs. In this presentation I will show a few examples of why it's an excellent environment for programmers, and why it's crucial to understand.

  TALK 2: Top Ten IntelliJ Tips
  In this talk, Trisha shares with you the top tips shamelessly stolen from everyone she's ever pair-programmed with. Learn keyboard shortcuts you never knew you needed, and dramatically increase the speed of your coding.

  TALK 3: Vim for Victory
  If there is one tool that makes me more powerful in my day-to-day life, it is Emacs. In this presentation I will show a few examples of why it's an excellent environment for programmers, and why it's crucial to understand.

  Getting more out of the org mode file attachment system, yes you can do it.

  I made a video about org mode attachments a while, you can see it here:

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPUdbLFJmqs

  And a video about my rolling log system:

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzq6WTWt0FU

  I wanted to revisit this idea and expand upon it a little.

  You can attach all kinds of files to a node in org mode, but sometimes you will want to attach files that Emacs cannot open properly.

  What you can do is open your attachment directory in the shell, open your file manager, and this will zap you right into the attachment directory, to save some time and energy.

  LSP Bridge's goal is to become the fastest LSP client in Emacs.

  LSP Bridge uses python's threading technology to build caches that bridge Emacs and LSP servers. Lsp-bridge will provide a smooth completion experience without compromising to slow down emacs' performance.

  Wrapping text is a fundamental aspect of writing in Emacs. But how should your wrap text? Soft or hard? What are the pros and cons? That's what I explore in this video.  We'll take a close look at visual line mode and auto fill mode.  And you can decide the ultimate question: how will you choose to wrap your text in Emacs.

* How to use Emacs when you're new on the job
:PROPERTIES:

  You've landed your first job in IT and would like to use Emacs, but are worried about the time it takes to set it up? Are you worried that your colleagues will expect more from you and that it would be safer to use VS Code or whatever the others are using? Here's how I solved that when I started out as a developer in 2003:

  1) Setup the development stack that "everyone" around you are using (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse)
  2) In your spare time, set up Emacs to do the same
  3) Configure both editors to auto reload files so you can quickly Alt+Tab between them
  4) As you grow into the job, so will your Emacs setup
  5) As months go by, you'll use Emacs more and more and the "everyone editor" less and less.

  With this approach, you can take your time to ease into the job, learn all the other things you must in order to deliver. At the same time, when time allows, you can re-create the setup using your preferred tools, like Emacs.

  To have Emacs automatically reload files changed in VS Code, IntelliJ++, I use:
  ```
  (global-auto-revert-mode 1)
  ```

  The Emacs Desktop Notification Center (EDNC) is an Emacs package written in pure Lisp that implements a Desktop Notifications service according to the freedesktop.org specification.

  EDNC aspires to be a small, but flexible drop-in replacement of standalone daemons like Dunst.

  This tutorial is focused on Common Lisp and Emacs Lisp macros. Lisp macros are one of the things that has kept lisp relevant to this day. Since no matter how languages try to mimic them they just never fit as well as they do in Lisps. I hope to do a future video on hygienic macros like you see in Scheme and Clojure. In addition, cover macros on a deeper level in the future.

  - More Example Macros

  In this video I share some more advanced examples of interacting with the mark and region. They're summarized here.

  Kill-ring - a ring-buffer of previously wiped text, access with C-y, then repeated M-y.
  M-@ - select next word, and repeat this command to expand the region
  M-h - select whole paragraph (e.g. function in code)
  C-x h (or C-x C-p) - select whole buffer (e.g. copy whole file)
  transient-mark-mode - enabled by default, this minor mode highlights the active region after you set the mark
  C-u C-SPC - Cycle through the ring of previously set marks (e.g. bookmark points in the file).

  00:00 Intro
  00:24 Kill-ring and multiple yanks
  01:43 Expanding the region by word
  02:19 Selecting functions and whole files
  02:56 Transient Mark Mode

  Using edebug in Emacs to troubleshoot a problem with the org-noter package.

  Some of the keyboard shortcuts I used:

  - `C-u C-M-x` to instrument a function so that edebugger can be used.
  - `Space` or  `c` to step through the code
  - `H` or `M-x edebug-goto-here` to run to cursor

  Emacs-libvterm (vterm) is fully-fledged terminal emulator inside GNU Emacs based on libvterm, a C library. As a result of using compiled code (instead of elisp), emacs-libvterm is fully capable, fast, and it can seamlessly handle large outputs.

  In this video i show you how to install vterm and multi-vterm in emacs and the settings you need to add to your emacs init.el file and shell config

  I also cover vterm copy mode and adding keyboard shorts for multi-vterm,
  as well as the new windmove command on emacs 29

  Update:
  I did have an issue where vterm was installed but prompted me to reinstall the vterm library

  Making Music! In Emacs?! by Zachary Kanfer

  During quarantine, I found myself spending time with an Android app. One of the features this app has is composing music that loops endlessly. As with many programs, I wondered how much better this feature would be, if only it was inside Emacs. This talk explains how I made zmusic, my implementation inside Emacs, with detours through Emacs text properties, font rendering, the WAVE file format, and music theory. And hopefully at the end, we’ll have something worth listening to.

  Zachary spends a lot of time coding Lisp, playing guitars, and doing improv. He also runs Emacs NYC, and recently got into hats. Find him at zck.org.

  In this video I describe how I made the emacs package ido-numbered-mode, in only a few days, with zero knowledge of emacs lisp.

  This video is in part a tutorial for emacs lisp, and in part a tutorial for software engineering in general.

  It's designed to help people that hear "the code is the documentation" or "just read the codebase" or are first joining a project with a big codebase and are lost/don't know how to start or don't know how to ramp up when reading a big codebase.

  This should help you figure out how to quickly learn the context for new engineering projects and environments.

  In this video we showcase using Emacs as a Kotlin IDE, using packages like lsp-mode with kotlin-language-server. Some of the features are not that well documented, so you might learn about new ones in this video :) Some gotchas are relevant for other languages using lsp-mode as well, like the renaming and code actions parts. yasnippet is useful for Rust programming with rustic as well! :)

  If you have problems debugging: Remember to rebuild your project with Maven or Gradle!!! Should probably have mentioned this in the video, but forgot :(

  So finally I am able to generate big contracts with only few lines of code. The whole process is super simple using org mode combining both macro replacement and include option in my org files.

  When writing big documents you may want to use macro replacements, they are like variables which will be replaced by the global value on export. Saves lot of time and helps you in creating consistent documents.

  M- : hold alt down for the next keystroke OR
  strike escape once then the key

  When you are executing a command, watch the bottom of your emacs window.
  That last line of text below the highlighted-line is very informative.
  It's called the 'minibuffer', so keep that in mind.

  In questo video discuto l'articolo How I manage my blog in cui faccio vedere come gestisco il mio blog tramite hugo, emacs e ox-hugo. La pipeline che utilizzo ha tre step: gestisco il contenuto dei post in un file org-mode tramite emacs, utilizzo il pacchetto ox-hugo per esportare i vari post in relativi file markdown, e infine utilizzo hugo per esportare i file markdown nei file html, css e javascript che vanno poi a formare il sito statico finale.

  Nel video menziono anche un concetto importante che purtroppo molto spesso dimentichiamo: è importante conoscere bene la potenza degli strumenti che utilizziamo in modo da scegliere lo strumento più appropriato per il task da risolvere. Non c'è bisogno sempre di scegliere strumento più potente, perché il potere può si aiutare in tanti contesti, ma può anche creare danni in tanti altri contesti, specialmente nel mondo dell'informatica e dunque della sicurezza informatica.

  Learning the basics, getting started with customizing Emacs to fit your needs.  Your needs will be different, unique to your workflow and preferences.  Emacs can meet you where you are.  You just need to do some customizing.  In this video, we will go through an easy path to getting started.

  I recommend getting started learning what comes out of the box before you start customizing.  You won't be able to learn everything, just the basics, and at some point you will find a need to customize something small, the like a variable, and you can start to re-design elements of the program around your work.

This video will focus on dired within Doom Emacs, using the evil keybindings (vim-like keybindings).   Although this video is nearly 30 minutes long, it barely scratches the surface of the functionality available within this excellent file manager!

  emacs client not working with your ssh keys with programs like magit and tramp even though you have added your ssh keys and its working with emacs

  The problem may be how you have started using emacs --daemon in your window manager  or systemd

  The issue is the emacsclient needs to be able access the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable from the parent process that contains the path to the ssh-agent socket that is created when you use ssh-add

  The fix to get emacsclient to use your ssh keys is to start emacs using the emacsclient in your desktop application launcher like rofi, this starts the emacs daemon and allows the emacsclient to access the ssh variable for the ssh keys

  Dont start emacs using systemd because it doesnt use variables set in your shell config files, and starting emacs with emacs --daemon in your window manger sets the parent process to your window manager

  So the short answer is starting emacs with emacsclient using your desktop launcher fixes the issue of emacsclient not using your ssh keys

  In this live-coding session, we'll begin creating a package. The idea behind the package is to easily display and create reference cards in a temporary buffer. As I'm coding, I'm learning about interactive mode, creating windows and buffers programmatically, keymaps, and more.

  It had been a while since I recorded one of these videos and I didn't have the aspect ratio of my Emacs window quite right—thus the blank space on the right. I'll try to remember this next time and have the Emacs window fill the entire screen.

  Note that this isn't a tutorial necessarily as I'm learning as I'm going. Instead, this is a look inside the process I use to learn new concepts and put them into practice.

This took longer than I expected, and I became frustrated with Emacs' lack of documentation on the one feature the entire editor is based on (modes). We do eventually get it working. After this, we decide to alter how functions are parsed in order to (hopefully) have less code duplication and better semantics when it comes to parsing types of function parameters, as well as the function return type itself. This is (like it sounds) kind of a giant task, so we don't finish this in this video, and end up getting stuck at a bug near the end of the stream. Luckily, we've figured out what the bug was caused by, and we will begin next stream by fixing the bug and moving on with our lives :^).

  I do want to say I'm sorry for this stream :/. I feel like I didn't bring the proper mindset to the stream and I don't like how I treated some of the viewers and chatters while I was frustrated. It is something I will do my best to be better at; you viewers don't deserve having to listen to me yell at my computer screen why it's not working :p. I thank any and all of you for watching, and hope you can forgive me for forgetting the number one reason we are here: "be excellent to each other, and party on, dudes!".  Honestly, I'm even embarrassed to post this video, and I wish I could just sweep it under the rug with no one noticing; alas, the video is part of the development of the compiler and therefore must be published. It would be kind of nonsense to just start tomorrow's stream like this one never happened, and I don't think it would be respectful to those who watched live. \endrant :/

  As always, thank you to all those who were able to make it live, and to all watching in the future. You are why I'm still here.   -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/lens_r

* Emacs: Cursores Múltiples, Árbol de Deshacer, Use Package (español argentino)

  Veamos un repaso de algunos de los paquetes que más nos pueden ayudar. Multiple Cursors permite editar múltiples lugares a la vez. En este video, creo dos funciones en Emacs Lisp para proveer una funcionalidad más intuitiva usando las funciones de multiple-cursors. Undo Tree persiste el historial de deshacer entre sesiones y provee una manera gráfica muy intuitiva de deshacer y rehacer en un árbol de estados. Use Package nos permite automatizar la instalación y configuración de paquetes; lo ponemos en marcha para transformar un .emacs.d en un repositorio de Git fácil de descargar y usar en una instalación nueva de Emacs.

  Notas de este video:
   - Casi al final, las listas de multiple-cursors no quedaron configuradas en el repositorio que descarga los paquetes automáticamente. Esto fue (como sospechaba) porque el comando 'cp' no copió el archivo. Esto no ocurre al clonar el repositorio, que además es la mejor práctica (o usando bien cp|rsync).
   - Use Package tiene otra opción muy útil que no me di cuenta de comentar, y es defer, que permite retrasar la carga del paquete hasta que estés inactivo por N segundos. Otra es ensure-system-package, que permite llamar al gestor de paquetes del sistema para instalar un programa. Una última es disabled, que permite desactivar todo un bloque de use-package. Todas estas cosas, verlas en https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package.

  Pequeña introducción al editor de código EMACS. Aunque se trata de un editor más bien antigua, emacs presenta algunas características interesantes, como su flexibilidad y adaptabilidad. Este editor se basa en el lenguaje Lisp ("LISt Processor", o "Procesamiento de Listas"). En este vídeo, veremos cómo movernos por el archivo de código, como copiar y pegar texto, cómo navegar por otros archivos desde la misma ventana o cómo buscar y reemplazar cadenas de texto.

  ¡ Esperamos que este contenido te sirva y sea de tu interés !

Para ese barco, se calcularán el escantillonado a través de ejemplos a mano y utilizando el software SCT. El curso incluye una licencia temporal gratuita de este software. Más información sobre el software SCT aquí: http://www.boatscantlings.com

  Además de estos, podrás encontrar otros cursos de otros temas relacionados con el mundo de las embarcaciones a vela. De estos cursos no somos nosotros los autores pero son igual de interesantes.


  Aparte de eso, en Matemáticas y barcos nos interesa el tema de los CFD en general, y su aplicación a la ingeniería naval, en particular. Sobre este tema, podrás encontrar también un par de cursos de los que somos autores:

  3) Curso sobre OpenFoam: https://ingeoexpert.com/cursos/curso-de-simulacion-numerica-de-fluidos-con-openfoam/
  En este curso aprenderás los rudimentos del CFD OpenFoam a través de varios ejemplos de aplicación:  "Cavity", los problemas de Couette y Poiselle, un perfil aerodinámico y un Dam Break.

  4) Curso sobre CFD para aplicaciones navales (OpenFoam):
  https://ingenierojorgejuan.com/es/c/109/simulacion-numerica-para-aplicaciones-navales
  En este curso podrás aprender algunas aplicaciones más avanzadas centradas en casos de interés práctico en ingeniería naval. Estos casos son:
  - Un ensayo de remolque.
  - Un ensayo de propulsor aislado, es decir: la simulación del flujo en una hélice para obtener sus curvas de funcionamiento.
  - Un ensayo de plataforma flotante en olas.

  In today's stream, we'll automate a particular task that I don't find very fun: editing YouTube video descriptions.  We'll use Emacs Lisp to interact with the YouTube Data API to pull down a video's description, edit it in a buffer, and then save the description back to the video! If you thought Emacs Lisp was only for major and minor modes, this might prove that it can do a whole lot more.

* Ron Minnich - How to get super small linuxboot images and still have everything you need with the 'cpu' command

  Do you want to have all the tools on your linuxboot system that you have on your desktop, but you can't get them to fit in your tiny flash part? Do you want all your desktop files visible on your linuxboot system, but just remembered there's no disk on your linuxboot system? Are you tired of using scp or wget to move files around? Do you want to run emacs or vim on the linuxboot machine, but know they can't ever fit? What about zsh? How about being able to run commands on your linuxboot machine and have the output appear on your home file system? You say you'd like to make this all work without having to ask your Sysadmin From Hell to Do Magic to your desktop?

  Your search is over: cpu is here to answer all your usability needs.

  CPU is a go implementation of Plan 9's cpu command. It uses the go ssh package, so all your communications are as secure as ssh. It can be started from /sbin/init or even replace /sbin/init, so you have teeny tiny flash footprint. You can see the code at github.com:u-root/cpu. It's also small: less than 20 files, including tests.

  CPU runs as both a client (on your desktop) and an ssh server (on your linuxboot machine). On your desktop, it needs no special privilege. On the linuxboot system, it needs only fusermount. On the remote machine, it mounts a FUSE server into a process private name space at important places like /home/$USER, /bin, and so on. It implements remote file access by relaying FUSE requests via gorpc to a server embedded in the cpu command. The desktop command services those requests; you don't need to run a special external server.

  CPU will change your life. You can forget about moving files via scp: once you 'cpu in', the /home directory on your linuxboot node is your home directory. You can cd ~ and see all your files. You can pick any shell you want, since the shell binary comes from your desktop, not flash. You don't have to worry about fitting zsh into flash ever again!

  - named, dedicated shell buffers for specific apps with shell-mode
  - running rich TUI apps like top and vim inside Emacs using vterm
  - having multiple vterm buffers with multi-vterm

  I spent a couple of hours today playing with my Doom Emacs config.  In particular, I focused on some font settings which I think help with aesthetics and with readability.  In fact, I think one of the biggest reasons that I use Emacs over Vim is how Emacs renders fonts.

  Precepts of "Programming In the Small":

  1. MIMO: Minimal Impact, Maximum Obfuscation

  Write an excruciatingly specified if-statement to isolate the
  conditions under which the misbehavior occurred.  That way, you've
  limited any fallout to that singular scenario.  Then justify the
  hamhanded fix with a long comment.  2a1fe083, 7792f7b, eef185d,
  2e7402b, bedb3cb, 83218cf4, ....

  2. Ponzi Compounding

  Parent hacks beget child hacks to sustain their parents.  289b457.
  This ensures programs already incomprehensible only become more so.

  3. Don't Touch Anything in the Incan Tomb

  Swashbuckling archaeologists and programmers would do well not to
  disturb, much less *gasp* remove, gold idols from their ancient
  resting places.

  4. The Macgruber Conjecture

  Never cut a wire that's been around long enough.

  5. Bottomless suitcase preservationism

  Pack your entire shoe closet.  They might have snowshoeing down in the
  Caribbean.  Same goes for code comments.

  Scimax is a highly customized Emacs configuration for scientists and engineers.  So far, using scimax has required you to install Emacs, the scimax code, a working LaTeX, Python, and a host of utility programs.  It is a task.  In this video, I will show you that it is now possible to run almost all of scimax in a browser using GitHUB Codespaces!

  With Codespaces we can pre-configure a container that has all of those programs already installed in them so you don't have to do it yourself, you just have to launch the Codespace and get started.

  You can find the repo for this at https://github.com/kitchingroup-codespaces/cs-scimax. You probably cannot start the codespace yourself, but you should be able to clone it to your own GitHUB organization where you can launch it.

  In the last couple of years, I have really started to write everything in Org Mode.  Whether it be articles, documentation, scripts, programming...I use Org for all of it.   But, there is one thing that kind of bugged me, especially with my literate programming using Org.  I hated having to constantly run org-babel-tangle to export my files.   I found a solution!

  Here are some tips for navigating an emacs org mode file. I cover the following:
  - Easily copying/pasting code blocks
  - Easily copying/pasting sections
  - Searching for strings (C-s)
  - Jumping to a line in the document (M-x goto-line)

  Some helpful Emacs key bindings:
  TAB - collapse expand section, code block, caption, figure, etc.
  C-a - go to beginning of line
  C-[SPACE] - set mark
  C-e - go to end of line
  M-w - copy selected text
  C-y - paste (Emacs: "yank") selected text from clipboard (Emacs: "kill ring")

  Not discussed here:
  C-k - "cut" (Emacs: "kill") selected text

  For more information about Emacs, see:
  Introduction to Emacs - https://youtu.be/ZMEcb2rpauU

  0:00 Start
  0:45 - Collapse, copy, and paste a collapsed code block
  1:45 - Collapse, copy and paste an org section
  2:26 - Searching (C-s)
  3:54 - Goto line

  If you need to quickly upper case or lowercase a bunch of words or regions in your Emacs buffer, you need to know this, because they will save you some time.

  Many Vim users find Doom Emacs overwhelming at first, because of the orgy of documentation.  There is so much to learn!  Don't worry.  You don't need to learn everything on Day One.  If you already have a strong foundation with Vim commands, then you are almost ready for Doom Emacs.  But here's a few other things you need to know on Day One.

  This video covers an elisp snippet that starts its evaluation life cycle by yanking the entire current buffer and then proceeding to call a bash script that runs xdotool operations to find and bring to focus a QEMU/KVM Windows 10 guest, thereafter it continues to send the following key combos:
  Ctrl+A (Select all - presumably the source text in your editor within the Win10 VM)
  Backspace (Delete all the old text)
  Paste (It pastes the previously yanked contents)
  Finally the script sends the F11 key which executes a compile and run command within the IDE that I am required to use (Dev-C++).

  The script has some hard dependencies on a QEMU/KVM Windows 10 LTSC VM (It's the leanest SKU in my opinion) running under X11 and your Window Manager (in this case; IceWM) being EWMH compliant enough to allow switching to the QEMU/KVM window and activating it (bringing it to the front), additionally you must ensure that your editor source page is left focused in the VM otherwise when the script switches to the VM it will paste the clipboard contents into whatever else was left focused prior.

  In this talk I would like to introduce the usage of TeX and templates along with generating ad-hoc class and style files for working with orgmode. In particular, I will highlight also the process by which literate programming practices can be implemented with babel. This allows for a more native and flexible alternative to vendor locked in systems like Jupyterlab which rely on JS based inelegant approaches towards TeX typesetting. Finally, I would like to go into how to leverage CI methods for TeX workflows augmented with git.

  See: http://angg.twu.net/pict2e-lua.html

  00:00
  00:14  Page: http://angg.twu.net/pict2e-lua.html
  00:39  The Try it!: has two eepitch blocks
  00:52  has a link to the definition of eepitch block
  00:56  copy the eepitch blocks to a temporary buffer
  01:10  these bullets are equivalent to red stars
  01:18  let's run these eepitch blocks...
  01:49  these lines install Debian packages
  01:59  I will explain this setenv later
  02:07  this clones the github repository
  02:19  # (find-fline ...)
  02:33  /tmp/pict2e-lua/edrxlib.lua
  02:50  my init file for Lua - for pretty-printing
  03:01  the setenv makes Lua use my init file
  03:12  # (code-c-d ...) defines lots of functions
  03:15  including find-pict2elua
  03:22  # (find-pict2elua ...) opens a Lua file
  03:30  Here is one of these Lua files
  03:32  here is a kind of index of the file
  03:34  some of these links point to tests
  03:38  For example if we follow this link here
  03:42  we go to a test block, and we can execute
  03:44  this test block with a series of f8s.
  03:49  The f8s create a target buffer running Lua
  03:55  creates data structures and prints them
  04:03  There's one thing that is very tricky
  04:20  in some of the tests we need to show the PDF
  04:25  a command that splits the screen in three
  04:33  the command that does that is (etv)
  04:40  this header contains two blocks of one-liners
  04:50  and we need to execute all the sexps in
  04:53  the second one
  04:56  I'm going to execute them with M-7 M-e
  04:58  that is equivalent to M-e down.
  05:11  The last test in this file calls (etv)
  05:20  the first part of the test is very easy
  05:24  nothing special - it just sends commands
  05:26  to Lua - but then we have this line here
  05:29  that calls a class called Show, that saves
  05:36  some TeX code to a .tex file and runs
  05:38  latex to compile it and to generate a PDF
  05:42  the important thing is that this takes
  05:46  several seconds to run and we need to wait
  05:59  until it says blah blah blah Success!!!
  06:02  then we can run this (etv) here, and it
  06:05  shows a drawing - a bounding box in yellow.
  06:15  In Pict2e1.lua the drawings are not very
  06:18  interesting - this is just the core library
  06:24  Let me show how to draw the orbit.
  06:40  This defun here defines the function `a'
  06:43  as a function that opens the first Lua
  06:45  file - with the core definitions - and `b'
  06:48  defines b as the function that opens the
  06:50  second Lua file with some extra classes
  06:54  and some stranger drawings.
  06:56  So let's execute `b', and go to
  07:09  Plot2D-test2.
  07:12  So here we have a test block -
  07:16  it's quite big - it defines...
  07:19  it changes the preamble,
  07:21  it defines several functions, it uses some
  07:24  classes that are defined in this file...
  07:28  and then after printing the TeX code
  07:32  it has this line here that contains a
  07:34  show. If I execute to this line it takes a few
  07:38  seconds... it says Success!!! and now we can
  07:40  show the .pdf. And: ta-da!
  07:44  this is the figure that I wanted to show.
  07:47  So, that's it. Again: this is a
  07:53  library that is not interesting in
  07:55  itself, but
  07:56  i think that the way in which it can be
  07:58  tested - which is very similar to the way
  08:01  in which I'm developing it
  08:03  is interesting in itself - so
  08:05  if you are interested in test blocks
  08:08  please test this,
  08:10  and send feedback. That's it! bye =)

  One of the benefits of using Emacs is that it has so many useful tools built into it, including a nice IRC client that allows you to chat within Emacs.  This could be useful if you need to ask a help/support question related to the project you are working on.  Or maybe you just want to get away from your work for a bit and relax with some chat.

  This package provides a simple approach to setting up a "focus mode".  It uses the 'page-delimiter' or the outline together with some commands to move between pages whether narrowing is in effect or not.  It also provides some optional aesthetic tweaks which come into effect when the buffer-local 'logos-focus-mode' is enabled.  The manual shows how to extend the code to achieve the desired result: https://protesilaos.com/emacs/logos

* MTL workflow (preprocessing japanese text, using deepl and then  emacs mtl mode for post edits)

  This video is a demo of different tools I made for making MTL, it can make doing the translation easier for me, so I'm hoping it does that to others too.

  Here are the programs:
  Preprocessing Script: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/mtl-related-scripts
  Jisho-Chibi: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/jisho-chibi
  Mtl-edit-mode: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/emacs-modules

  Preprocessing will process the text so deepl gives better translations, make less mistakes for the names and so on.

  Jisho chibi is Qt interface for jisho.org website.

  Mtl-edit mode is minor mode for emacs. It has functions to help edit the mtls.

  The distro.tube website has been up for a couple of years.  It is a static website written in Org mode in Emacs.  Until yesterday, it was about 50 pages.  I decided to add another 21,000 pages to the site.  Why?  Because I wanted to see how viable it is to maintain such a large static website using Emacs and 'org-publish' .

  Using emacs to capture timestamps from mpv using the mpv.el package,
  converting the timestamps into start time and duration with awk and then
  creating the video clips with ffmpeg

  You can use the mpv.el emacs package to control mpv and inset the playheads currernt position as a timestamp into an org file

  you can then export the timestamp and convert them into start time and duration with the clip-time script and use the output of that script with the scene-cut script to trim the video clips to the milliseconds with ffmpeg

  or run capture the timestamps with the mpv.el package store them in an org document and run some source code blocks and run ffmpeg from within the org file and trim all the clips without leaving emacs or using the terminal

  I forgot to mention you need enable org babel support with the following code in your emacs config

  mpv.el is a emacs package that allows you to control mpv using the JSON-based IPC protocol.

  control mpv with emacs set up
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g0Wl37T8OQ

  to enable milliseconds in mpv on screen display edit your ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf file and add the following code

  osd-fractions

  You can then capital O in the mpv player to show the onscreen display with milliseconds

  Correction:
  the mpv-play command doesnt have to be used in an org document to open a video with mpv, the mpv-play command also works in the mini buffer and subtitle files

  Note:
  Youtube says there is a copyright claim for some of the audio from Night of the Living Dead (which is the public domain)  when i was rewinding the video and playing they are coming to get you Barbara

  What they are saying is me rewinding the video and playing the audio is actually copying someone song, what are the odds of me exactly recreating a bit of audio that someone has in a song that they have copyright over from a movie thats in the public domain and doesnt have a copyright, how does that work ?

  so it forced me to trim 10 seconds out of the video, so there will be a point in the video about the 14 minute mark where the video suddenly jumps

  i also cover the different syntax used by srt and vtt subtitles files

  mpv can be controlled by external programs using the JSON-based IPC protocol

  emacs has a package called mpv that allows you to control mpv using emacs  and jump to a position in the video when your cursor is on a timestamp in an org document

  The main purpose of the mpv.el package is to jump to timestamp in a subtitles file so you can fix any errors in the subtitles

  org-timers and the mpv package dont support seeking to the milliseconds
  in videos so i have overridden the mpv and org-timers functions to add millisecond support so you can seek more accurately

  You can also insert the current playhead position into an org document in with the ffmpeg format for timestamp hh:mm:ss:ms 00:00:00.000,
  so you can mark sections of video and use the timestamps with ffmpeg to trim the video into sections

  Using the emacs hydra package you can create an mpv mode which sends your keystrokes to mpv over the json interface allowing you to use keys like hjkl to seek back and forth in the video.

  You can also insert the playheads current position into the org document with milliseconds and use the timestamp with ffmpeg, pause and quit the video as well

  Subtitles notes
  vtt subtitle files timestamps will seek to the millisecond because they use a decimal point for milliseconds, but uses a comma and not a decimal point so they only seek to the second

  the format in vtt subtitles file includes a decimal point for milliseconds
  00:00:05.080

  But the srt subtitle format uses a comma and not a decimal point
  00:00:05,080

  to do:
  enable seeking by a single frame backwards and forwards using the comma and period keys, the mpv commands are called frame-back-step and frame-step, which should work with the mpv-run-command from mpv.el

  i got it working once then it stopped working not sure why

  ("," mpv-run-command frame-back-step)

  In this video I do some simple data analysis for my lab students using org-mode in Emacs. First I construct some very simple tables, and then I write some AWK code blocks to average the data across replicates. In the next video I'm going to show how I took that data, calculated a trend line with Python and then plotted it with gnuplot.

  I also tried out some video editing to trim the parts where I was fumbling around in man pages. The transitions are a bit rough (I used ffmpeg, which probably justifies its own video), but I cut out about 20 minutes. Hopefully that makes the video a bit more palatable.

* Emacs Minibuffer Completions

:END:
  This video explores Emacs minibuffer completions.

  What are completions? The user types an argument fragment, and Emacs suggests possible completions for that fragment. Completions make emacs faster and easier for the user.

  Examples of when completions are used:
    Run command (M-x)
    Switch buffer (C-x b)
    Find file (C-x C-f)
    Get info (C-h R)
    Etc.

  Vertico is a nice Completion UI.

  The full list of standard completion styles are provided by the variable completion-styles-alist.
    orderless
    emacs21
    emacs22
    basic
    partial-completion
    substring
    flex
    initials

  You can set the completion styles you want to use with the variable completion-styles.
  (setq completion-styles '(basic substring orderless))

  Question: Since we're providing a list of styles, which one is used? Answer: Emacs will use the first style that produces results.

  Question: How do I know how each style behaves? Answer: Use just one style and see how it behaves. Or read the Info Manual.

  Question: Why does emacs prepend styles to the front of my completion-styles list? Answer: Emacs has a set of category styles that it prepends by default (see completion-category-defaults). You can override the defaults (see completion-category-overrides).

  To learn more, see the Help for the variable above or see the Emacs code in minibuffer.el.

  The LiTeX mode which stands for Lisp to LaTeX is a minor mode for text modes in emacs that can transform your valid lisp expressions into LaTeX expressions you can render into beautiful PDFs.

  Github link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/litex-mode

  Github README has more details on how to use it, though some of them are also explained in this video.

  And for people who don't know what emacs is:
  In simple terms, it's a text editor which is extensible, and we can add as many features as we want like this.

  In this video I show off the pieces of Emacs Lisp I use to set the initial evil-mode states in various modes and to update keybindings therein. Both of these became very important (at least for me) with the introduction of evil-motion-state, which is a bit of a hybrid between evil-emacs-state and evil-normal-state.

  In this video I build off the configuration in Part 4 to add support for the Rust programming language, which I also install in the VM. Since we did the heavy lifting with lsp-mode and company-mode from the last video, it's a pretty quick setup.

  I also briefly explore navigating file outlines with the consult package and how you can set buffer-local variables.

  In this video I put together a basic setup for IDE-style features like code completion, linting, and code actions for languages that support the Language Server Protocol inside of Emacs. I also added which-key to help with keybindings and flycheck-mode to help with displaying the warnings and errors from lsp-mode. After this general configuration, I add my Go-specific configuration and test it out on a minimal example program. I also add some extra code analyzers to lsp-go and set up a global binding for compilation.

  Now that we lsp-mode and company-mode ready to go, put your suggestions for future languages in the comments! I'm already planning to do Python and Rust, but I could try to figure out some others as well.

  Título: Introducción a Linux. M11. Operaciones con emacs.


  Descripción automática: En este video, se muestra cómo realizar operaciones básicas en Emacs para el trabajo diario. Se comienza abriendo y ajustando el tamaño de fuente de un archivo para trabajar más cómodamente. Luego, se explica cómo buscar una cadena de texto dentro del archivo y reemplazar múltiples apariciones de esta cadena con otra.

  Para eliminar líneas, se enseña el uso de comandos específicos y cómo cortar un rango de líneas y pegarlas en otra parte del archivo. Además, se demuestra cómo trabajar con múltiples ventanas, cambiar entre ellas y abrir diferentes archivos en cada buffer.

  El video también aborda la edición de archivos protegidos, indicando que no se pueden hacer cambios si no se tienen los permisos adecuados. Finalmente, se muestra cómo guardar las ediciones y cerrar el programa, incluyendo consejos para el uso eficiente de la tecla Control, comúnmente utilizada en Emacs, y cómo asignarla a otra tecla más accesible para mayor comodidad.

  If you want to run code blocks inside Emacs, some customization is necessary. This is done with an initialization file that Emacs picks up when starting, from the $HOME location on your PC.

  The video covers download of the .emacs file from the web, and opening Emacs with or without it, finding the $HOME directory. In another video, I explain how to download Emacs packages with the package manager, and how to change the layout.

  - Get the .emacs file from the web: https://tinyurl.com/lyonemacs
  - Test installation: restart emacs - you should see no menu or tool bar at the top (the init file that you just installed contains commands to switch them off).

  Org-mode allows you to run code in many programming languages inside GNU Emacs. This video shows how to create a simple Org-mode file, define a C code block, run the file inside Emacs, extract C source code from the Org-mode file, and run it on the CMD line terminal. See also: assignment in GitHub.

  Conditions: you must have the GCC compiler MinGW installed and in the PATH, and you must have my .emacs file loaded by Emacs.

  - Create a working directory with C-x d followed by + and the name
  - Create an Org-mode file (.org) with C-x C-f first.org RET
  - Font change with C-x C-= followed by + or - or 0
  - Meta information always begins with #+
  - To undo any key sequence: C-/ (or C-x u)
  -Org-mode links are surrounded by [[ and ]]
  - To name the code block use #+name:
  - Code block begins with #+begin_src, and ends with #+end_src
  - You need to add a header (minimum: programming language, e.g. C)
  - Add the statement inside the block
  - To execute the code block use C-c C-c (with the cursor anywhere inside the block)
  - To mark a region, use C-SPC
  - To go to a link, use C-c C-o

  Org-mode allows you to tangle (or extract) source code files from code blocks. Watch "Running a C program inside Emacs" before this video, if you don't know how to create a named code block.

  - Add header information: :tangle hello.c :comments both
  - Inside the code block, enter M-x org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t)
  - Open a UNIX shell in Emacs with M-x eshell
  - At the command prompt, enter ls -la to see all content
  - Compile hello.c by entering: gcc -o hello hello.c
  - At the command prompt, enter ls -la to see all content
  - Execute the file hello.exe by entering hello
  - Open Dired (C-x d) and look at the file hello.c

  In this video, I show how to create a hello world shell script as an Emacs Org-mode code block, then start an Emacs shell (i.e. inside Emacs) and run the same script there, too.

  Conditions: you must have bash.exe installed and in the PATH of your PC so that it can be found by Emacs. You must have GNU Emacs installed. You must have my sample .emacs file loaded by Emacs.

  To install the bash.exe shell program, download and install CygWin, a suite of utility programs for Windows from here: https://cygwin.com/install.html

  - Make sure you have bash shell: open eshell inside Emacs (M-x eshell) and enter the command  "which bash". On Windows, you should get the location of the file bash.exe
  - Create a code source block for the language bash in an Org-mode file.
  - Add a bash statement: echo hello world
  - Run the code block with C-c C-c. You should see the output.
  - Next, create a file hello.sh which has in its first line the code #![path to bash.exe]. Get the [path to bash.exe] from the shell with which bash.
  - Save the file and run it in the eshell with ./hello.sh.

* Emacs from Source Part 2: vertico, orderless, and marginalia

  In this video we continue the Emacs From Source series by setting up the completion system vertico for Emacs, along with a new completion-style from the orderless package, and some completion UI enhancements from marginalia. I also take care of the annoying backup and auto-save files popping up everywhere, turn off the menu-, tool-, and scroll-bars, and set a visible region color.

  Timestamps:
  00:00 Introduction
  01:40 Brief look at defaults and ido-mode
  03:38 Hiding backup and auto-save files
  08:20 Installing vertico
  10:11 Installing orderless
  12:15 Struggling with read-buffer-completion-ignore-case*
  13:55 Installing marginalia
  15:30 Setting region color
  17:32 Turning off bars

  *I did eventually figure out the problem with read-buffer-completion-ignore-case. If you have an exact match, obviously vertico will select that. The situation I encountered the other day was more like "long buffer name including messages" and that was getting matched instead of *Messages*. Setting this variable to t does fix that situation. I just picked a bad example.

* Browser-based Productivity and PKM with emacs, org-mode, LogSeq and BrainTool :org:

  In this video I walk through my personal setup showing how Chrome, Emacs/Org-mode and LogSeq can be tied together via the BrainTool browser extension.
  See more details at https://braintool.org

  BrainTool is a free and open source browser bookmark tool that makes it easy to add notes to your bookmarks, organize them into a topic hierarchy and then use that hierarchy to open and close groups of tabs and thus control your browser. It is unique as a bookmark manager in that it is designed to interoperate as part of a larger system of personal knowledge management and productivity tools.
  It achieves this interoperability by saving your data into an accessible plain text file written in the emacs standard org-mode format. Org mode is a set of plain text tools used to manage tasks, to do lists, notes, links, journal entries and almost any form of text-based information.

  Most org mode users interact with it via the emacs text editor but it can be used in any text editor and is increasingly used as a format by other tools such as the LogSeq* personal knowledge manager, the Flat Habits iOS ToDo manager and Plain Org an iOS org-mode editor.

  Here I show how the notes, links and todo items captured by BrainTool in your browser can be accessed and edited in org mode and then used to drive a task manager. The same plain text file is also shown synced to LogSeq and being navigated in the LogSeq user interface.

  All three tools are automatically kept in sync by virtue of using the same org mode file as backing store. Currently this requires syncing BrainTool to a Google Drive file and using the Google Sync app to sync your GDrive to a desktop folder. Emacs and LogSeq can then read and write the BrainTool data file locally. Some care needs to be taken to allow time for the local and remote files to sync before moving between tools.

  If you are new to BrainTool the other videos in this playlist give a short introduction.

  After finally trying out the native compilation feature of Emacs 28, I wanted to make a quick video showing how to reconfigure and rebuild Emacs with this functionality enabled. This is also our first foray into the AUR, where we needed to get the libgccjit package. As a result, I spend some time discussing how to use the PKGBUILD files you get from the AUR and debugging an issue with a missing GPG key.

I also added rainbow-mode and used it to help change the color of my dwm title bar.

  emacs open files with external programs using the openwith package,
  the openwith package lets you specify file extensions and the programs to open them with.

  openwith works with dired and files opened with the mini buffer as well

  The files are opened in the background so you can continue to use emacs while the file is open, this is particularly useful for opening videos from within dired

  I also cover how to suppress the this is a large file are you sure you want to open it prompt so you can just press return on a file and automatically oen it with the program you specified

  I often get viewers asking me about what skills they should learn to become a "power user" or "elite."  While there are so many important skills that one could learn, I think the two most important programs that every Linux user owes it to themselves to learn are Vim and Emacs.

  📺 In this video, I will show you the intuitive and productive workflow (clone/stage/branch/log/push, etc.) of Magit, one of the killer apps in Emacs. It's the best Git client.

  💡 The Emacs version I demonstrated here is 27.2, and I didn't customize anything of Magit. It just runs well out of the box. Install magit as below:
  #+begin_src elisp
  (require 'package)

  (setq package-archives
        '(("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/")))

  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-initialize)
  (package-install 'magit)
  #+end_src

  In this video I go through how to configure a basic setup for #Emacs when using it for #C #Programming. I don't incorporate any linters or autocompleters, preferring to have a basic setup to write code without too many distractions.

  Every time you install a package with emacs it adds the name of that package to a variable called package-selected-packages

  You can then copy your .emacs file to another machine and run install-selected-packages and it should then install all of the packages in your config

  But i could never get it to work until i figured out you need to move the package-selected-packages code block above package-initialize

  and after package-initialize add the following code

  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))
  (package-install-selected-packages)

  📺 In this video, I will show you the sweet feature of Emoji typing that Lars Ingebrightsen brought to Emacs 29 a month ago.

  💡 The Emacs version I built here is 29.0.50, and the Git version is f1116f45bcabc5628e7443a2c792971c7c23b8b1.

  🛠️ If you want to build Emacs yourself, follow the INSTALL instructions: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/INSTALL

  📝 Lars Ingebrightsen's blog post: https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2021/10/28/emacs-emojis-a-%e2%9d%a4%ef%b8%8f-story/

  The title I was typing (at 48 second of this video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2lHLRT4nlk&t=0m48s ) while recording the video should be "Typing emoji characters in Emacs was never so easy!", sorry!

  In this video I show you how I setup #Emacs for #frontenddevelopment (#html, #css, and #javascript). I first inhibit the startup screen and inhibit any potential cl warnings, before hiding the tool bar. After that we install the following packages: js2-mode, emmet-mode, markdown-mode, web mode, and prettier. We also turn on electric pair mode.

  After that we install the following themes - atom one dark, material, gruvbox, and dracula. After installing these packages and themes we configure our init.el to support our new packages. Note: during this process we use terminal emacs.

  This tutorial is focused on getting Vim style keys in Emacs without having to install Doom Emacs. With the rise in Emacs distros I have seen a rise in reliance on them to avoid learning Emacs. While I am all for people using what works for them I wanted to make a video to help those who want to learn vanilla Emacs while still keeping Vim keys everywhere.

  Emacs is much more than a text editor.  It is its own complete environment.  It is almost like an operating system unto itself.  In fact, it has everything that you would expect a fully functioning operating system to have...including GAMES!

  Find Your (In)voice: Emacs for Invoicing
  Bala Ramadurai

  Ye Freelance warriors, please lend me your I/O devices for 5 minutes.

  Your time is your money! Do you find it a pain to generate an invoice, record the details into your accounting software and keep track of taxes and payments? You are not alone, I found the whole invoice thingy to be extremely painful.

  But worry not, Emacs comes to our rescue.

  My talk will give you a basic intro on how to use org mode, some embedded python code and file jugglery to generate stylistic and professional invoices.

  What you will learn during the session:

  How to track your freelance time using orgmode
  How to create the basic infrastructure for invoice generation
  How to generate the invoice
  How to manage multiple clients
  How to enter the finance details into your accounting software
  How to track invoice payments
  We will use the following packages:

  Emacs+orgmode (duh?)
  yasnippet
  python layer (I use spacemacs, so whatever is the equivalent in your config)

  Using #orgmode as a computational notebook is one of the main uses of scimax for me.  I have started using emacs-jupyter to run Python in org-mode, and this video will show how it is integrated into scimax, and some scimax specific features of Jupyter in #Emacs.

It's a common story.  A person hears about Emacs and wants to give it a try, but their initial experience is usually pretty bad.  Why?  Well, I think a lot of it has to do with three HUGE mistakes that new Emacs users tend to make.

  One of the core, critical features of Emacs is completion, where you choose from a set of possible candidates and then do something with that choice. ivy is one of many completion tools, and still one of my favorites. In this video I will show how ivy works with Emacs and completion, and some customizations I have made for it in scimax.

  So far I have focused on how org-ref supports inserting citations, cross-references, etc. and how it provides hyperfunctional links that give access to a variety of functions to act on those links, including export to different formats.

  This is only part of the story though; the other part is the database of bibliographic entries. org-ref exclusively supports bibtex as the database format, and org-ref provides support for adding new entries, maintaining and editing those entries, and navigating them. This video shows some of those capabilities.

  📺 Keyboard macro is a nice text editing feature of Emacs, in this video, I will show you how to use it to make a numbered list quickly in 2 steps:
  1. Hit F3 to start defining a macro, and edit the text as usual, then hit F4 to end the definition.
  2. Hit F4 to apply the macro.

  Numbered lists are common in org-mode or markdown text, so this feature could help.

  org-ref has several options for handling citations in exports. LaTeX is the gold standard, but is not always what you need especially for export to HTML or other formats. CSL may do what you want if you can find the right style.

  org-ref has a third, new option that leverages LaTeX's citation processor with natbib and bibtex for other formats. This video will illustrate how it works.

  A small hill I might die on is that citations belong in the sentence they are used in, and not outside them. However, in some citations styles, especially superscripted numbers, I agree it looks nicer for the superscripted number to be on the right-hand side of punctuation.  The achemso package in LaTeX provides natmove, which lets you put citations where they belong while writing, but that moves them when the final document is build.

  org-ref provides a natmove preprocessor for this same purpose, so you can put citations in the sentences where they belong, but move them during export to the right place if you want to. This video illustrates that.

  org-ref was originally designed for writing scientific papers that would be converted to a PDF via LaTeX, where LaTeX would do all the cross-reference processing. That is not helpful though if you want to export to HTML or ODT, or any other non-LaTeX format! This video introduces org-ref-refproc, which provides similar functionality as cleveref in LateX to non-LaTeX exports. For example, you can get clever prefixes that automatically add Figure/Table etc in HTML, with reasonable numbering, etc.

Luckily, there are other citation processors available, and notably there is now a Citation Syntax Language processor package (citeproc) you can install in Emacs. org-ref uses this package to provide formatted citations and bibliographies in non-LaTeX exports.

  Searching for things in my collection of org-files is a very common activity for me. =scimax= has a library called =org-db=, =org-db-images= and =org-db-full-text= for this. Every org-file is indexed and the results are stored in a SQLITE database for future queries.

  This allows me to search for content in every org-file that has ever been indexed with a variety of scopes.

  Rust is a unique programming language that blends imperative and functional concepts to make low-level systems safer. However, compared to other modern languages, designing APIs in Rust requires a fundamentally different mindset -- for example, designing without classes or inheritance. In this talk, I will live-code the design of a simple Rust API. Through the evolution of the API, I will demonstrate how Rust’s type system (especially traits) can be used to design interfaces that cleanly compose with existing code, and that help API clients catch mistakes at compile-time.

  Emacs or EMACS is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as "the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor".

  Doom is a configuration framework for GNU Emacs tailored for Emacs bankruptcy veterans who want less framework in their frameworks, a modicum of stability (and reproducibility) from their package manager, and the performance of a hand rolled config (or better). It can be a foundation for your own config or a resource for Emacs enthusiasts to learn more about our favorite operating system.

  Hundreds of blog posts, articles, etc. are produced every week that you might want to read. It is very hard to keep track of all of them! RSS feeds can be used to collect brief summaries of these which helps but often isn't quite enough. You need an RSS reader that can help prioritize the entries, and that makes it easy to do things with them, like open the full entry, email or capture information from them. Elfeed with Emacs provides exactly this tool, and it is fully extensible so you can plug in scoring tools. In this video I will show how I have used and extended elfeed to help keep up with things happening in Emacs and the scientific literature.

  Looking for a more productive and intuitive way to revert Git commits? This video is for you.

  In this video, I will demonstrate how to discard/revert Git commits in three ways, including:
  1. hard reset:
  2. revert
  3. soft reset

  Magit is one of the killer apps of Emacs, you should definitely give it a try, and you'll never look back to use the vanilla Git CLI.

  Reference:
  - Magit: https://magit.vc/
  - git reset: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset
  - git revert: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert

  Timeline:

  03:08 2. revert
  06:14 3. soft reset

  In this stream, we'll take a brief detour from our usual EXWM hacking to experiment with an idea I had today: "inverse literate" Emacs configurations.  The major benefit of a literate configuration in Org Mode is that it can easily be converted into a readable form online.  However, editing such a configuration can be painful for various reasons.  Let's try to come up with a way to write our configuration purely in Emacs Lisp while still producing an Org file for publishing the configuration online!

We'll do this by creating an Emacs Lisp script that can run separately from your Emacs configuration, even on CI systems like GitHub Actions or SourceHut Builds for full publishing automation.  I'll also show you how to improve the look of the generated site!

  A talk by Eric Collins

  You really enjoy doing everything in Emacs, editing text, managing all of your tasks, playing games like 2048, or building presentations, but do you read your email there? There are lots of options to choose from, but we’ll focus on setting up mu4e for seamless indexing and reading. This will include setting up supporting software that makes this all work together seamlessly to process your email.

  Bringing email into familiar keybindings dramatically improves your ability to read and process messages. It’s so helpful, you might just very well be able to achieve inbox zero.

  Topics that will be covered:

  - Locally caching messages using mbsync
  - Reading/indexing email with mu/mu4e
  - Sending email using msmtp
  - Attachments
  - Signing/Encrypting email using PGP

  The first part is here: https://youtu.be/PE714pm1kvE

  In this stream, we'll dig into Emacs history and take a look at some of the variants that have come and gone over the years.  I'm not an expert in Emacs history so I'm hoping some of you will be able to help fill in the gaps!

  Raymond presented his notebook software that uses Emacs to bring
  together multiple programs to make a single set of computations. It's
  able to pass data back and forth between these programs, generate
  results, and even output publication-quality documents. Raymond
  referenced a previous EmacsNYC talk Evan Misshula gave about
  reproducible research: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGnt_PWoM5Y

  In this stream, we'll continue looking into the technical details of Emacs-driven desktop window management by reviewing the EXWM codebase.  We'll start by finishing up our test setup with Xephyr and figure out how to debug the XELB communication used by EXWM.  I'll also try to start fixing our first bug in the code base!

  GNU Emacs is widely known as a text editor. However, it's much more than that. It has a web browser, a mail client, games, and even its own programming language called Emacs Lisp (a type of Lisp). It even has Tetris!

  Emacs allows one to search for the word under the cursor. Hit C-s C-w. To keep adding more words in to the search, just keep repeating C-w.

  Keeping a journal with Org mode as your capture tool is super simple. You can't afford NOT to do it right now. Think of all the great things you can be capturing in an org mode journal. One journal (or many) coming up, no waiting. Keep track of reading notes, sketches, idea, code snippets, stories, activities, whatever you want. The power of Org mode is yours.

  In the last few days, I spent some time rewriting my website.  I wanted to move over to a completely Emacs/Org-based website where I write everything in Org mode and then use Org Publish to convert everything to HTML.  This is fantastic since I write everything in Org.  All of my past show notes that I wrote in Org can now be easily added to my website.

  In this video, I'll show you how to use Org Roam's "dailies" feature to keep a journal or daily log in Emacs.

I'll also show you how you can customize the default template for daily entries to add any other information you'd like to capture.

  WhY boTheR with Emacs anyway?  Some people like the freedom, some people like to show off, but most of us just want to save time --- and have fun doing it.  A great way to save time and typing is to -- USE VIM?  No, use macros in Emacs.  This video will introduce you to Emacs macros in practice and show how to do it yourself.  Emacs macros can be recorded and played back in the moment, or they can be stored later as Emacs Lisp functions.   So it's the best of both worlds. Learn a macro, save a macro, be a hero.

  - embed executable computer programs in your documents
  - productivity
     - day planner
     - to-do list
     - contacts (“Rolodex”)

  Here, I provide an introduction to Emacs Org mode.

  Why count words? These days, word counts aren't terribly important? Or are they?  Paying attention to your word count can help you focus your writing, write with clarity, and avoid wasting your reader's time.  And the bonus you get with counting words in Emacs is that you also get character counts.  Character counts can be just as important in writing for web as word counts.  So have fun counting words in Emacs buffers.

  - Partial staging of modified files
  - Amending, extending, and rewording commits
  - Creating new branches from commits you've already made
  - Pushing branches to a remote repository
  - Pulling (and rebasing) commits from a remote repository
  - Discarding unwanted changes
  - Adding files to .gitignore

* Show your Emacs shortcuts in colour when giving presentations

  When you give presentations in which you use Emacs, other Emacs users would like to see the shortcuts you're using so that they can learn from you and your setup. The most famous mode for this is command-log-mode, however a more colourful, and in my opinion better, alternative exists in interaction-log-mode.

  This wee screeencast shows how it works and how you can keep the interaction-log-mode buffer open no matter what operations you or your plugins do in Emacs, including C-x 1.


  interaction-log-mode can be downloaded from: https://github.com/michael-heerdegen/interaction-log.el

  My Emacs configuration can be found here: https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/tree/master/emacs

  Often, people wonder about other things shown in the talk as well, like what theme and terminal is being used, thus:

  - The terminal multiplexer used is tmux, my conf is here: https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/tree/master/tmux
  - The terminal used is kitty, my conf is here: https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/tree/master/kitty
  - The desktop environment used i3, my conf is here:  https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/tree/master/i3

  Emacs has a really neat mode built into it called prettify-symbols-mode.  You add a block of code into your Emacs config listing words and corresponding symbols.  Anytime you type one of the words, Emacs replaces with the symbol or emoji that you specify.

  Presentation by Johan W. Klüwer, DNV. A new tool has been put together to simplify the work of creating templates, as a package of emacs functions and (textual) templates. With the emacs-ottr-toolkit, you can efficiently create and edit templates, including docTTR annotations, and test templates with example data. The tool also simplifies the use of Lutra to check for errors and generate documentation, reducing the effort needed to get template libraries published. A short walk-through of how the tool is used will demonstrate how this works. See https://gitlab.com/ottr/pub/emacs-ottr-toolkit.

  Probably one of the most common Vim/Emacs questions that I get is "Why would I choose Emacs over Vim?"  Or "what does Emacs have to offer that Vim doesn't?"  You see this question all the time from Vim users on message boards and support forums.  So I wanted to take a minute to answer it.

  Feito para eventual consulta futura. Aprendi a usar tentando resolver alguns códigos do livro "xchg rax,rax". Contém spoilers de um dos exercícios.


  A ideia é só realizar uma demonstração rápida da ferramenta. Gastei um tempinho me acostumando com o DDD (que é uma boa ferramenta, apesar de ser feia e ser mais orientada a uso de mouse), e passei um pouco de raiva tentando usar o KDBG (que é exclusivo de KDE e não consegui compilar). Tudo isso sem perceber que, possuindo o GDB, você pode usar praticamente qualquer coisa para te ajudar -- no meu caso, o Emacs, meu companheiro de guerra.


  É bem provável que os comandos aqui possuam bindings padrão para não ter que ficar digitando no console, mas eu fiz isso mesmo assim pra me acostumar a usar o GDB também.

  Emacs Org mode is huge and might overwhelm some people. Therefore, helpful features often gets lost in this large amount of documentation. In this talk, hand-selected tricks are demonstrated that may help the average Org mode user in her daily life.

  ---

  Bastien Guerry wrote [this article where he shows nice but rather unknown Org features](https://bzg.fr/en/some-emacs-org-mode-features-you-may-not-know.html/). His article inspired this talk which is about a selection of those features and much more here and there. It also covers some general Emacs features.

  For this talk, you should have a minimum level of experience with GNU/Emacs and Org mode. If not, it might provide some inspiration and motivation to start with GNU/Emacs. However the talk highlights only some features and tricks here and there, not providing a general overview.

  You can find the show-notes of the talk, links to external sources and the [colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)) on [this web page](https://karl-voit.at/2021/04/10/GLT21-emacs-org-features/).

  Please do send a short feedback [here](https://pretalx.linuxtage.at/glt21/talk/ZKEXNW/feedback/) after the talk.

  Doom Emacs on PostmarketOS.
  Important: Using VNC and recording the window using OBS has added extra lag and tearing, it's faster and there's no tearing when actually using the pinephone. Also the visual quality has been reduced.
  Although the pinephone isn't fast, I found it fast enough in most aspects to be usable, scrolling was a bit too slow though. It was very impressive to see the pinephone rotate near instantly, I'd bet it's faster than any android phone (it's faster than my snapdragon 855 Android).
  As you saw, everything in doom works like in the desktop version, sone things were cropped out though, Spacemacs does better in this aspect. If this was on a faster phone and with a custom keyboard layout, it would be hands-down the best mobile editor I've used.
  Configuration is definitely needed (I will post config soon), hopefully there will be more optimizations to make it faster and fix the choppy scrolling (pixel based scrolling).

  Let's continue working in my literate Emacs config file and refactor some git/Github functions we wrote last week. Time permitting, we'll also dive into the URL package as I have some ideas of things I'd like to do with the Github API at some point soon. I apologize for the camera issues I was having.

  In this video, we'll learn how to efficiently select text using Emacs' built-in key bindings!  We cover the "mark," the region, and the various ways we can use those to select text.  I'll also tell you about the "mark ring" and how it can be a very quick way to navigate back to previous locations you visited in the buffers you are editing!

  Check out the show notes here: https://systemcrafters.cc/emacs-essentials/efficient-selection-key-bindings/

  You can define custom keybindings in Emacs Doom using the `map!` macro. In order to the menu that appears when pressing the spacebar, you must use the `:leader` property. It is also possible to group keybindings into categories thanks to the `:prefix` property.

  I did an impromptu live coding session last week in which I did some Emacs Lisp refactoring and this is a bit of a continuation on that.


  Tonight, we'll continue creating some Github helper functions that help in my day-to-day coding. As a reminder, I'm a bit of a Lisp newbie having not written any Lisp (other than copy/paste) before a month ago or so. There are likely much better ways to do the things I'm doing here. If there are, please let me know in the comments!

  I'm getting used to some of my audio/video setup before I do some live conference talks next week. I figured it might be a good idea to do something live.

  I've been working on my own literate Emacs config for a while now and am starting to dive into Emacs Lisp. I recently wrote a custom function for opening pages in github and I think it is ripe for refactoring. So let's try that! I'm definitely no Emacs expert though.

  I use this setup everyday, for task management, creating pptx files, docx files, book notes, writing my own books, blogging, and just about anything I can get away with doing it in Doom Emacs.

  This is for writers (i.e. non-programmers). If that's you, I'm sure you'll have questions. I'll try to answer then if you ask them.

  I included most of the problems I ran into while installing Emacs and Doom Emacs because I wanted you to see how I got around them.

  In my never-ending quest to find the perfect way to create beautiful (yet minimal) websites, I had to try out Org Export in Emacs.  Since I tend to write everything in Org Mode these days, it would be amazing to simply be able to convert my Org docs into HTML, and maybe add a little CSS to spice things up.

  In this video, I'll explain how Emacs' display-buffer function is used to determine which window (or frame!) gets used to display a buffer.  This is useful when you want to prevent Emacs from breaking your perfectly-organized window layouts!  I'll go through many of the built-in "display action" functions to explain how they work.  We'll conclude the video by changing our configuration to prevent popup windows from being created and to cause Org Mode and Help buffers to reuse windows containing other buffers for those modes!

  Keep an eye out for the next video where we will cover display-buffer-alist and custom display action functions!

  I've been off work for a month on paternity leave. I was working on the third floor of my house in my office, but to be closer to the family with a newborn I'm temporarily in my old office (soon to be nursery). Because of the temporary setup I haven't brought my main desktop down and I'm using my laptop.

  My emacs is out of date, so I need to get it set up how i have it on my main machine. I could copy the init.el and get on with stuff, but why not show what I'm doing?

  Thanks for watching :). If you liked this video consider liking and/or subscribing, it's most appreciated.

  In this video, we'll learn how to use the features of 'use-package' to cause our Emacs packages to be loaded later so that Emacs starts up much faster than before!  We will also learn how to tweak the settings of Emacs' garbage collector so that it enables Emacs to do less work while loading up all of your packages.  By the end, we cut startup time of the Emacs From Scratch configuration in half!

  https://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/48/

  In a rare positive of 2020, GNU/Emacs 27.1 was released with a heap of new features, bugfixes and performance improvements.
  This was almost immediately followed by the usual Navel-Gazing and bike-shedding discussion that gets emacs-devel in the news.

  Buried under the suggestions of new key-bindings, better user on-boarding and new languages that should replace lisp this time were discussions for features desperately needed to drag Emacs forward.

  One such feature is the porting of Emacs to the Wayland display Protocol using GTK3. While seemingly simple at first glance, the history of the Emacs display engine would prove to make this a much more difficult task.

  In this talk I will cover the motivations and significant challenges of porting Emacs to use wayland, shed some skeletons from the code base, show the current state of the system before considering, what should be next for an editor that keeps on going.

  linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

  This video is about how I've been documenting complex functions and data structures by putting chunks of executable code in comments (in "test blocks"), and how I execute these chunks line by line with eepitch. The "line by line" trick lets me follow what each line does without having to add any comments.

  In this stream, we'll continue learning the fundamentals of Emacs Lisp by showing how to define functions and commands:

  - Basic function definitions
  - Function argument types (optional, rest)
  - Unnamed (lambda) functions
  - Invoking functions stored in variables and parameters
  - Adding documentation strings
  - Defining interactive functions (commands)

  We'll also start working on the basic steps of the Emacs package that we'll be creating for the rest of this series!

  This video is a tutorial on how to create an elisp hyperlink to "here" - where "here" is the current Emacs buffer, on a position on the current Emacs buffer - and how to copy it to our notes, all this with few keystrokes.

  More info at: http://anggtwu.net/2020-find-here-links.html

   0:00 Title page
   0:30 create a hyperlink to that
   0:54 1. The tutorials
   2:07  we are going to start with the beginner's way
   2:23  remember that `M-h M-k'
   3:05  demo of `M-h M-2' in the tutorial
   4:00  you can use it with the cursor at any point
   4:40 2. The beginner's way
   4:40 2.1. The 3-window setting - and going back from it
   5:00  I sometimes teach Emacs to people who
   5:04  I minicourse on LaTeX
   6:25  trick mainly meant for people
   6:47  `M-h M-3': three windows; `M-h M-1' goes back
   7:29  the original configuration can be anything
   8:55  let me explain how I teach this to beginners
   8:56 2.2. Copying one link
  10:10  when people know a few more keys ... C-w and M-w
  10:21  that correspond to Cut, Copy, and Paste
  10:30 2.3. Duplicating and refining
  10:53  as a string at the end of the sexp
  11:12  an example without so much clutter on the screen
  11:56  let me demonstrate this
  12:35 3. Using a single window
  13:19  go back usually by using
  14:00 4. Advanced usage: anchors
  14:18 4.1. Creating anchors
  15:22  an index at the beginning of the file
  15:47  the tutorial also explains ... `M-A'
  16:19  use `M-B' to create something like this block here
  17:02 4.2. The option :anchor for `code-c-d'
  17:21  here I have one of the source files
  17:30  here we have an index
  17:47  this sexp is equivalent to
  18:12  not all functions created by code-c-d behave in that way
  18:36  let me give the short explanation
  18:57  is a button that defines new functions
  19:04  and this sexp here shows the code
  19:24  this defun that defines find-eev
  20:04 4.3. Shrinking hyperlinks
  20:25  it has a demo here
  21:07 4.4. The preceding tag
  21:35  a variant of `M-h M-w'
  22:06  it also explains in the echo area what it does
  22:43  in this example the refined hyperlink is not useful
  22:48  but here is a demo that makes more sense

  In this video, we'll learn how to keep Emacs from cluttering up folders with temporary files it creates for backups, auto save information, and the configuration stored by other packages like Projectile and lsp-mode.  First we'll learn the necessary variables you will want to set to do this yourself and then we'll try a community package called no-littering that will do a lot of the work for you!

  Check out the configuration from this video here: https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/blob/a57d99ba80276926a2b68521f9a9d23dc173a628/Emacs.org#keep-folders-clean

* Some template-based functions of eev that are not five-minute hacks   :eev:
:PROPERTIES:
:YOUTUBE_URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91-9YfRPsuk

:DURATION: 33:12
:END:
  My presentation at the EmacsConf 2020 was titled "On why most of the best features in eev look like 5-minute hacks"; this is a complement to it.

  In most cases when I record "executable notes" on how to perform tasks (see my talk at the EmacsConf 2019!) I record them as plain text, but in a few cases I prefer to use functions that generate text from templates. This video is about some non-trivial cases of functions that use templates to generate "executable notes" that can then be executed in several different ways.

  For more on eev see http://anggtwu.net/#eev .

   0:00 Title
   0:17   the reason for this title
   0:18 1. `find-find-links-links-new'
   1:29   generated again with these values
   1:50   the implementation is very simple
   2:00   in five minutes because ... generates skeletons
   5:03 2. `M-x brep'
   5:43   a way to download local copies
   7:11   The new way: `M-x brep'
   8:15   by typing `M-x brep'
   8:50   and then we get this buffer here
   9:17 3. The function that defines brep
   9:38   `code-brurl' is a variant of `code-c-d'
  10:07   find-code-url shows the code instead of executing it
  11:26   this is explained in the main tutorial
  12:12   accept extra arguments
  12:34   if we run just this
  12:40   one of the reasons for using text: comments
  13:03   if we run just this with extra arguments
  14:10   code-brurl executes this code here
  14:20 4. `find-esetkey-links'
  15:20   a big header with lots of help
  16:28   I have these keybindings, for toggling
  17:06   I realized that I use `M-x wrap' very often
  18:18   in the emacs-devel mailing list
  18:32   users should not be forced to see lisp
  19:23 5. `find-youtubedl-links'
  19:43   if we twist the notion user enough
  20:02   user-friendly to me
  20:05   The documentation is in this tutorial:
  21:36   its code is here
  21:55   Let me show a demo
  22:15   I never type these rm -Rv/mkdir/cd by hand
  22:48   let me show how to download ... the hash is here
  23:25   they regenerate this buffer in slightly different ways
  24:03   a video with this hash. If I visit the directory
  24:32   my magic functions have to
  24:50   if I run this sexp here with nil
  25:00   it tries to guess the title
  25:28   and if I change this {stem} here I get short links
  26:14   has very long lines, but if I type super-w
  26:28   I get a buffer that shows the code for find-preadingvideo
  26:50   if I execute this I play the video
  27:15   make a copy of this that points to the right position
  27:53   summary: this is how I download videos from youtube
  28:12 6. `find-here-links' and `find-extra-file-links'
  28:20   it deserves another presentation just to itself
  28:32   the central idea of eev
  29:17   it is bound to `M-h M-h'
  29:25   generates a temporary buffer with hyperlinks to here
  29:30   help and a link to the tutorial in which I was
  29:45   not very well documented yet
  30:05   it is explained in this section of the tutorial
  30:18   if we type `M-h M-e' this runs `find-extra-file-links'
  30:42   here is an example in Lisp
  31:06   and I can change this {c}
  31:22   Let me show a more realistic example of how to use it
  31:28   let's go to the directory with the video file
  31:45   this file is a video file
  32:00   (a glitch)
  33:03   these were the things that I wanted to show

  NOTE:
  When I did the git clone of my dotfiles repo and copied over my .doom.d configs, my Doom configs didn't want to work properly initially, because my Doom configs expect the following packages to be installed.  So if you choose to use my Doom configs, make sure to install these!

  I've been playing a bit with my Doom Emacs configuration, so I thought I would go through my config files and explain what I'm doing.  This could prove to be quite educational to those of you that are new to Emacs in general and especially Doom Emacs.

  In this video we'll be learning about a new feature in Emacs 27 - the Tab Bar.  While the name might be misleading, this feature actually provides built-in support for workspaces to rival that of external packages like Eyebrowse.  I'll walk you through how you can use this feature to organize your windows into workspaces and also how to configure the feature to be more effective for your workflow.

  A quick look at UDB used command line in Emacs. UDB redefines debugging by delivering an entirely different workflow which accelerates finding and fixing bugs.

  Don’t step forward through code, simply time travel backward to find the answers. Debug Different.

  ▪️ Reverse debugging
  ▪️ Single step forward or backward
  ▪️ Run forward or backward
  ▪️ Hit breakpoints, conditional breakpoints & watchpoints - running forward or backward
  ▪️ Jump to a bookmark in your program’s execution history
  ▪️ Jump to specific a moment in time in your program’s execution
  ▪️ Full inspection of global and local variable values
  ▪️ Full compatibility with GDB commands
  ▪️ IDE support or use directly from the command line

  In this stream, we'll continue building the ultimate desktop environment using Emacs Window Manager (EXWM).  This time we'll learn how to optimize program window placement with the exwm-manage-finish-hook and a variety of commands provided by EXWM.  I will also show how to gain some extra screen space by detaching the minibuffer and hiding the mode line.

  In Org Roam we can set aliases for titles of our notes. This way we can refer to a single note using different names. This can be achieved using the `#+roam_alias` meta property.

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.

  Both options are great. I miss some of the features of Spacemacs, but the speed of doom is the best, and since Emacs is so extensible, I'll just tweak it how I want.

  Doom is better when it comes to speed and beginner-friendliness.

:DURATION: 15:21
:END:
  Writing a synthesis in archaeology is a complex challenge, especially when it requires large sets of data of a different kind to be collected and put in order. Using R to explore and comprehend information is just one part of this process. One usually needs a tool for code writing and interpreting at the very least and another tool for the textual side. Emacs and its Org-mode is an outlining combo that makes the whole process more consistent and more transparent in terms of scientific reproducibility. It allows every piece of research that makes up the publication to be written together in one text file. It can be compiled then and exported in one move to the format desired – most preferably LaTeX and PDF. The benefits of using R in such context and a software toolset have been examined in the writing of a comprehensive study of the Muslim necropolis on Kom el-Dikka. The study was based on a dataset drawn from analyses of skeletal remains of over 2,500 individuals excavated to date. The data was supplemented with archaeological investigation of almost 2,000 grave units to shed light on the changes that occurred in early Islamic Alexandria.

  Org Roam is a tool for organizing notes in Emacs built on top of Org Mode. It’s a replica of Roam Research, a web based tool that popularized this approach of organizing notes not in a hierarchical way, but as set of documents connected with links. Somehow similar to how the Web is organized. You write a note, then another and maybe you connected them with links if they are related. The key idea in Roam and in Org Roam is that for each note you can see on the side other notes that mention or reference the note you are currently viewing. By seeing the relations between your notes, you have more context about the information you are storing in them. It’s very simple, yet powerful. Finally, contrary to Roam Research, by using Emacs, you write notes as plain text. You can store them anywhere. And you are not locked-in to a particular vendor.

  * Capture a new note: `SPC n r c`
  * Add a link to a note: `SPC n r I`
  * See the backlinks: `SPC n r r`

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.

  org-journal is an Emacs mode for journaling built on top of org-mode. It maintains a set of files for journaling per day, week, month or year. Journaling entries are the headings.

  org-journal is included in Emacs Doom. You don't need to install it. Enable it in your `init.el` along with a simple configuration. Press `SPC n j j` to write your first journal entry.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs.

* Deft Mode · Emacs Doomcasts 23

  Deft is an Emacs mode for quickly browsing, filtering, and editing directories of plain text notes, inspired by Notational Velocity. It was designed for increased productivity when writing and taking notes by making it fast and simple to find the right file at the right time and by automating many of the usual tasks such as creating new files and saving files.

  Deft is included in Emacs Doom. You don't need to install it. Enable it in your `init.el` along with a simple configuration. Press `SPC n d` to trigger the Deft UI and start searching through your notes.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.

  The easiest way to install eev in Emacs is with `M-x list-packages'.
  This video shows how to do that and how to navigate its tutorials with the keys `M-e', `M-j', and `M-k'.

  For more on eev, see:
  http://anggtwu.net/#eev

  0:00 Hi!
  0:19 Let me load my notes...
  0:44 run M-x list-packages and wait a bit
  1:26 click on eev, click on install
  1:42 just installs eev but doesn't change any defaults
  2:25 installed but not active by default
  2:30 to active eev and to enter the tutorial: M-x eev-beginner
  3:06 a section about how Emacs deals with elisp expressions
  3:17 elisp expressions that can be used as hyperlinks
  3:41 you just need to remember two keys
  3:48 for the beginners: quitting and restarting
  4:06 the part of the sequence of keys
  4:21 go to the file menu, click quit
  4:46 enter emacs again, type M-x eev-beginner
  5:17 here are the main keys
  5:35 M-e goes to the end of the line and...
  6:28 you can forget practically evertything
  6:41 if you type just M-j
  6:48 has a header that is beginner-friendly and
  7:20 if I execute this ... (find-emacs-keys-intro)
  7:30 a copy of the instructions that I showed before
  8:06 in the other sections: Emacs concepts, other Emacs keys
  8:19 hyperlink to the section about quitting in the manual
  8:48 most of the entries have hyperlinks to the manual
  9:48 these lines explain ... M-j with numeric prefixes
  10:17 section 6: eepitch - how to control shells
  10:36 if I type [f8] six times here
  10:50 we have a shell running inside Emacs
  11:22 oops, I forgot to explain M-k!

  Doom Emacs is my preferred text editor, and I have made several videos about it.  But some of those videos assumed that the viewer had some knowledge of Vim and/or Emacs.  So I decided to make this Doom Emacs introductory video for the complete noob!  This video covers how to install Doom Emacs, how to configure it, and some of the basic keybindings and commands.

  There seems to be a misconception about Emacs.  Many think that Emacs is only useful for programming.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If you do any kind of writing, you owe it to yourself to take a look at the tools that Emacs offers.

One of the sticking points for the Linux community has been our beloved "man" pages.  Why does it have to be "man"?  Well, in Emacs...it doesn't!

  This video continues the series on editing with GNU Emacs from the Linux command line.   In this video we demonstrate how to delete lines or regions of text and restore those lines.   We also show how to turn on the feature that displays the column number of the cursor on the mode line.

  One of the killer features of Emacs is Org-Mode, which is a kind of markdown that makes creating outlines, tables, source code blocks, and tables of content really easy.  Often, when people discover Org-Mode, they start wanting to rewrite all of their configs as literate configs in Org.

  ERRATA:
  I mentioned in the video that this would work on any config file written in an actual programming language.  That 's not actually the case. Tangle will work on anything, so it doesn't have to be a programming language, since we are not really evaluating the code with this.  We are just writing what's in the SRC blocks to the file we specify.

  NOTE:
  I did all of this on a live stream earlier today but the stream had some buffering issues.  I thought this topic was too important not to go back and  re-record.  I have removed the earlier live stream.

  I spent several hours this week cleaning up my configs for XMonad and Emacs.  Why?  Well, my XMonad config had grown to more 1,000 lines in length.  This made it a bit unwieldy and hard-to-read.  My Emacs config was also suffering from readability issues due to all the comments I was leaving in the config.  I found a solution to both of these problems.

  Magit is an Emacs package that provides a convenient UI to the version control system Git. Magit aims to improve upon Git commands in order to make simple things faster and complicated things simple.

  Magit is already included and configured in Emacs Doom. You can use SPC g g to initiate the status page. Most Git commands are done from this status page. The status page provides comprehensive information about the current context changes. You can easily see files diffs and selectively stage parts of a file.

  In this episode we learn how to merge pull requests directly from Emacs using Magit and the Forge package.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.

  Emacs isn't a text editor.  It's a desktop environment!  I used to think that was a joke.  But they weren't joking.  Install an Emacs plugin called EXWM (Emacs X Window Manager) and add a few lines to your emacs config.  Voila!  Emacs is your window manager.

  17:08:31  From kevin : Yeah xmonad is tiling, written and configured in haskell
  17:09:39  From adam : https://xmonad.org/ I remember that it was pretty complicated to figure out the config, but it makes you feel pretty cool lol!

  17:16:38  From Roger Pate : always Vim so far :)
  17:17:17  From kevin : You can use evil-mode for emacs to get vim functionality
  17:17:45  From Rob Creel : I wouldn't complain about upping the font size a few steps. :)
  17:20:44  From Josh Martin : @Kevin that is very true
  17:58:57  From Rob Creel : I've got another meeting at 6, but thank you for having me!  After 5 years of half-hearted research and debate, I should probably decide soon whether to learn vim or emacs! :P  This presentation is a tally mark in the emacs column for sure.  I hope to make it back next month.  Cheers!
  18:17:06  From adam : https://indyhackers-slack.herokuapp.com/
  18:20:44  From Gerep  To  Josh Martin(privately) : I came in late sorry but I am curious about spacemacs. I am a vim user and a friend suggested it. I am not sure if that is a good way to start and try Emacs, what do you think?
  18:22:47  From Gerep : I came in late sorry but I am curious about spacemacs. I am a vim user and a friend suggested it. I am not sure if that is a good way to start and try Emacs, what do you think?
  18:23:13  From kevin : Gerep - that could work, also doom is a nice config
  18:23:31  From Gerep : so, spacemacs with doom?
  18:23:40  From kevin : Spacemacs or doom
  18:24:03  From Gerep : Ah! got it, thanks.
  18:24:05  From kevin : They are both pretty similar from what I’ve seen
  18:24:32  From kevin : Or you could just use the evil-mode package in emacs, that’s what I do
  18:29:37  From Roger Pate : thank you!

  Run bash scripts from Emacs buffer, without leaving the buffer.


  after writing buffer content to file, run it with



  xterm -fullscreen -fa "Liberation Mono" -fs 25 -fg green -bg black -e "sleep 0.1s;bash $temp_file; read junk; exit 0"


  or use python, cc, gcc, perl etc in place of bash.

  Zetteldeft is an Emacs package built on top of Deft for organizing notes with IDs and tags. Its very fast and a lot of fun to use while studying. I highly recommend this package.

  I'm assuming that you read a bit during the day. Books. Webpages. And Magazines. And you might watch videos, and attend online or in person classes. And maybe other forms of content. And if you do, it's worth taking notes. But how do you connect the thoughts and be able to take action on what you learn. In this video I introduce you to a couple tools that I think can make an enormous difference in your lives. If you end up using either one, let me know.

  Lambdas. All the cool kid languages have them. But does 'lambda' mean what C#, Java, Python, C++, etc. mean by 'lambda'? Where did lambdas come from? What were they originally for? What is their relationship to data abstraction?

  In this session we will into the history, the syntax and the uses of lambdas and the way in which lambda constructs in various languages do (or do not) match the original construct introduced in lambda calculus.

  - Emacs can be daunting - helm mode can beat that.
  - Still, why emacs?
  --A. org-mode, may be a lisp, may be for the next 40 years; or ...

  A minimal set of packages to conquer emacs: https://github.com/digikar99/emacs-noob. For something more full-fledged, and especially if you are into Vim, there are Spacemacs and Doom-emacs. My complaint: they customize emacs too much; I find emacs to be something that grows along with the user.

  PS: There are still many many things left out of the video: magit,  hideshow, imenu-list, company autocompletion framework, lsp and eglot (say, what?), evil mode, interactive REPLs, indent-by-mode. I'm also aware that at one place in the video, I have used C-x C-f instesd of C-x C-s.

  Can Emacs replace a full IDE, like Pycharm, or Jetbrains, or Android Studio? If you actually use the IDE features, and work on 1000+ line projects, then, probably not.

  1. `spc spc` and then `workon` to find the command for switching virtualenvs. It's not clear in the video. Apologies for that.

  2. the packages I install are flake8 isort yapf python-language-server

  In this video I cover the absolute minimum setup for doing Python development in Spacemacs.

  - I start off with a discussion of Python virtualenvs and how to get them set up correctly for Spacemacs.

  - Then a discussion of code completion.

  - Afterwards I show how to explore and fix issues found by a linter (flake8)

  - And then go over how to run scripts from inside emacs.

  - Finally I demonstrate a language server based completion backend.

  So I'm glad I stuck with playing with standard GNU Emacs for a few weeks.  I think it was beneficial to learn the default keybindings and see how Emacs can be built from the ground up.  But I need to move back to using the Vim keybindings to save my sanity.  So I'm checking out a distribution of Emacs called Doom Emacs.  It uses the Vim bindings and includes a nice, sensible configuration that is easy to modify.

         C-x C-f for find file
         You can type full path to a file or create a new document.
         You could also just open the path to a directory and find the file.
  (2) C-x C-+, C-x C-- For Zoom In/Out
  (3) Basic Navigation
         C-n, C-p, C-f, C-b
         M-f, M-b (forward/back by words)
         C-a, C-e (beginning/end of line)
         M-a, M-e (backwards/forwards by sentence)
         M-{, M-} (backwards/forwards by paragraph)
         M-"LESS THAN", M-"GREATER THAN" (beginning/end of file)
         M-g g (goto line number)
         ESC-number C-n/p/f/b (perform motion that number of times)
  (4) Cut, Copy and Paste
         C-space to select text to copy/cut
         C-w cut highlighted
         M-w copy highlighted
         C-y paste
         C-k cut to end of line?
         C-x backspace, M-k (backwards/forwards delete the current line)
         M-z character cuts to that character
         ESC-number ESC-d deletes that number of words
         C-x u undo
         C-h v kill-ring
         C-x 0 to close the kill-ring window
         C-y Esc-y to cycle through kill-ring for paste
  (4) Buffers
         C-x b select another buffer
         C-x C-b list all buffers
         C-x k kill a buffer
  (5) Case change
         M-c capitalizes a word
         M-u uppercase word
         M-l lowercase word
  (6) Spell Check
         M-$ check current word
         sudo pacman -S aspell-en (for Arch users)
  (7) Query replace M-% (shift-5)
         Will only look forward in the file!
         RET exits the query replace
  (8) Search
         C-s to search forward
         C-r to search backward
  (9) Splits
         C-x 2 Horizontal Split
         C-x 3 Vertical Split
         C-x 0 Close window
         C-x 4f Opens file in other window
         C-x o moves cursor to next frame
  (10) Save and Exit
         C-x C-s Save
         C-x C-c Quit

  Description:
  Newcomers to our favorite editor are often amazed by the ease with which they can customize the environment to suit their needs. Whether they consider themselves to be a “programmer” or not, it isn’t long before this amazement gives way to strong feelings of empowerment upon realizing that it only takes a few keystrokes to begin studying and improving any part of the Emacs source code. But rather than being something unique to Emacs or just a part of working in a Lisp-based editor, GNU Emacs’ ability to empower its users has as much to do with *GNU* as it has to do with Emacs.

  Emacs is a flagship program of the GNU Project in more ways than one: for not only is it a successful and communally developed free software project, it’s also perhaps the one closest to the original vision of the GNU system – a full computing environment centered around user freedom and empowerment. Emacs did not get to where it is today because of its technical excellence alone. Rather, the success of Emacs is inseparable from its being free software. The great proliferation of communally shared packages, modes, and extensions is not a *quirk* of Emacs, but instead a vision of what the average computing experience could be in a world that had as its chief focus a respect for its users’ freedom. As lovers of Emacs, what can we do to work towards this future, and bring the joy of computing back to all? With this talk I hope to explore the ethical values that led Emacs to its current position, and point to ways that we can help further its wild and messy, but enduring and egalitarian spirit.

    • Quote from https://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.en.html
      • "It was Bernie Greenberg, who discovered that it was (2). He wrote a version of Emacs in Multics MacLisp, and he wrote his commands in MacLisp in a straightforward fashion. The editor itself was written entirely in Lisp. Multics Emacs proved to be a great success — programming new editing commands was so convenient that even the secretaries in his office started learning how to use it. They used a manual someone had written which showed how to extend Emacs, but didn't say it was a programming. So the secretaries, who believed they couldn't do programming, weren't scared off. They read the manual, discovered they could do useful things and they learned to program."

  Description:
  You are an Emacs Lisp developer and you own a few Emacs packages. This talk will guide you through configuring flycheck, package-lint, checkdoc, ERT, and others so you can be confident your package is of top quality. To make it stay that way, the talk will also show you how to setup github and gitlab so each commit is checked before getting merged.

  Notes from pad:
    • slides: https://files.petton.fr/cassou/emacsconf2019/presentation.html
    • checklist for MELPA
    • naming, docstrings, small functions, automated tests, package metadata
    • avoid warnings; speaker believes they are just as important as errors
    • suggests Melpa's contributing.org as a good reference for quality: https://github.com/melpa/melpa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org
    • Example ERT test setup example
    • Example of a Buttercup test
      • `M-x buttercup-run-at-point'
    • He tends to use ERT most often
    • Example of using flycheck in a buffer
    • Advice: run flycheck on your own code, don't worry about everyone else
    • Remote setup
      • tools needed: cask, emacs-package-checker, emake, makel
    • makel can use Makefiles to ensure dependencies and alias commands - good for continuous integration
    • Configuring CI to use specific version of Emacs to be tested:
      • evm, nix-emacs-ci, silex' emacs, kelleyk's ppa
    • Example configurations for TravisCI, Gitlab CI, Gitea+Drone,
    • Q&A
      • Gitlab..
      • Any CI systems using Guix yet?
        • A: not sure yet
      • Is Melpa's standard the accepted one?
        • Their contributing.org file is a really good one

  Slides and transcript: http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-transcript.html

  Description:
  Recently, a reddit poster asked others their default scripting language. While Perl and Ruby have often sparred for that position, for me, the Shell has always been that comfortable old shoe to get things done. At least, until a few years ago when I realize that since I’m always in Emacs, why shouldn’t I just write my transient helper scripts in Lisp?

  Didn’t take long to realize why I didn’t jump on that idea earlier. It isn’t very scripty. However, Lisp is moldable, and it doesn’t take much to become the scripting language of your dreams.

  But I’m not talking about some fancy new functions, I also have to talk about the required paradigm shift: From invisibly piping text from executable to executable, to visibly transforming a buffer with calls to multiple functions. So let’s change our workflow from script arguments with completion to function calls with completing read from Helm/Ivy. I daresay, this workflow can be much better.

  Slides: https://github.com/jonathanchu/emacsconf-2019-magit-deep-dive

  Description:
  The abstract of the talk would be focusing on some of Magit’s more useful and lesser-known features, as well as dig into the internals of Magit to gain a better understanding and insight of git ultimately. More concretely, I would start with some helpful configuration options such as formatting the “magit-status-margin” and then go into some Magit commands such as “magit-branch-spinoff” and “magit-cherry-harvest” - talking about how to use them, how they work, and what’s going on under-the-hood. There is a long list of excellent Magit porcelain commands to choose from while still being accommodating of all experience levels with Emacs and Magit.

  Slides: https://bytedude.com/files/managing-your-life-with-org-mode.html

  Description:
  If you’ve tried various systems for managing your time you may have found them to be too complicated, too inflexible, or just too much work. org-mode and org-agenda in particular have a lot of features and can be overwhelming to get started with. However, using only a subset of their features they can still be flexible, simple, and powerful. This talk will provide you with some tools and ideas for creating a simple system catered to your needs, with a full demonstration of how I use these tools myself. We’ll be going over org-mode and org-agenda as well as some configuration which makes them easier to use, after which we’ll cover third-party packages and tools such as org-recur (written by the author), org-super-agenda, git, and more.

  Description:
  I use Emacs every day and I believe it has a massive boost in my productivity, and I’d like to talk about why, and how. I’m hoping to cover Emacspeak, using elisp to make packages accessible, and writing accessible interfaces to things that are not accessible.

  Notes from the pad:
    • screen readers
    • Emacs is making things possible for blind people that would be hard or impossible otherwise :-)

    • Questions:
      • Are there any modes that come with Emacsspeak configuration "out of the box"?
        • No Emacs packages come with Emacspeak configuration, but Emacspeak itself comes with a lot of configuration for different packages like org-mode, Magit, and many many others.
      • Do you, Parham, prefer emacs modes to not have any customizations around emacsspeak so that you can customize them yourself?
        • Yeah, no customizations is great. The problem with most applications, outside Emacs, is that people try and guess how a blind user for example would use their package/application. However, in Emacs, the cool thing is that you don't have to do it any more and let the user figure it out.
      • Are there any "rules" that package developers for emacs could use to make them more emacsspeak friendly or at least avoid being emacsspeak hostile?
        • I would say that the best way would be to just use Emacs functionality. Some packages do weird things with custom overlays, for example, which Emacspeak has a hard time accessing.

  Magit is an Emacs package that provides a convenient UI to the version control system Git. Magit aims to improve upon Git commands in order to make simple things faster and complicated things simple.

  Magit is already included and configured in Emacs Doom. You can use SPC g g to initiate the status page. Most Git commands are done from this status page. The status page provides comprehensive information about the current context changes. You can easily see files diffs and selectively stage parts of a file.

  In this episode we learn how to combine Magit with the Forge package in order to be able to issue pull requests directly from Emacs. Using the create pull requests command we specify one of our branches as the base for this pull request. Once submitted, the pull request appears on GitHub.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.

  Literate Programming is about creating narratives. Programs
  are part of the narrative. Invented by Donald Knuth in the
  1970's, literate programming inverts the idea of code and
  comments. Rather than comments supporting code, we now have
  code supporting a narrative.


  Key learnings:
  1. Introduction to emacs Org-mode
  2. How to do multi-language literate programming using Org-mode

  No prior knowledge of Emacs is necessary. However, if you
  come to the talk with a laptop, please make sure Emacs and
  Org-mode are installed on it.

:END:
  Interactive theorem provers like Coq, Agda and Idris allow programmers to ask questions about incomplete programs (or proofs) to Emacs, and get meaningful answers based on types of the missing parts. This turns programming into a conversation between programmers and their compilers, where Emacs acts as an intermediary. However, programmers are limited in the kinds of questions they can ask. Recent work on extensible editor actions leverages metaprogramming techniques to specify how the compiler should answer custom questions, but that requires writing code in Emacs Lisp to glue the compiler and the editor interface because metaprograms can only command the compiler and not the editor itself.

  In this talk, I will describe editor metaprogramming, a novel idea of writing metaprograms that command the editor. I define a monadic embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) for editor commands in Coq, which enables composing these commands in meaningful ways, with the full power of Coq! I will write an interpreter for this eDSL in Emacs Lisp, and make Emacs and Coq processes communicate back and forth. Coq computations will be sent back to Coq, and effectful editor actions such as deleting a character and moving the cursor will be executed in Emacs Lisp.

  Interviewed by Hansen Hsu and Marc Weber on 2019-03-15 in Mountain View, CA X8971.2019
  © Computer History Museum

  James Gosling is known as the father of the Java programming language. Growing up and attending college in Calgary, Alberta, Gosling began his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University in 1977, finishing in 1983. While at CMU, Gosling developed the first Unix version of Emacs, learned about byte codes while porting PERQ software to VAX, and developed the Andrew window system. After a brief stint at IBM working on a RISC computer, Gosling joined Sun in 1984, and created the NeWS window system. After NeWS lost to X Windows in the marketplace, a group including Gosling formed the Green project at the end of 1990 to explore consumer technologies, producing the Star7, a multimedia remote control. It was for Star7 that Gosling first created the Oak language, later renamed Java. After a brief spin-out from Sun as the company FirstPerson and an unsuccessful foray into interactive cable TV, Gosling’s team repurposed Java for the Web in 1994, which enabled dynamic and interactive web pages at a time when most were static. Sun partnered with Netscape to include Java with the Navigator browser in 1995. Sun’s goal was for Java to become a network-centric, platform-independent platform that would free computers from proprietary systems like Microsoft. While Java is less popular than other languages on PCs and web browsers, it has become the dominant language in enterprise computing, and a major player in mobile and embedded computing.

  Magit is an Emacs package that provides a convenient UI to the version control system Git. Magit aims to improve upon Git commands in order to make simple things faster and complicated things simple.

  Magit is already included and configured in Emacs Doom. You can use SPC g g to initiate the status page. Most Git commands are done from this status page. The status page provides comprehensive information about the current context changes. You can easily see files diffs and selectively stage parts of a file.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.

  Every item in a plain list can be converted into a checkbox, which makes it a simple task. Checkboxes in Org Mode start with square brackets. They are used to split a task into a number of simple steps, or to create a checklist.

  Checkboxes can be nested. In that case, the parent checkbox tracks the progress of its children. Additionally, there are markers to display the count, either as a number or as a percentage. These are called cookies in Org Mode. Those cookies must be attached to the parent element, either headline or another checkbox.

  Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.

  In Org Mode, tags can be used to correlate or group different tasks (or headlines) together, based on a context. Tags can be attached to any headline (not only task headlines) and they are displayed between colons.

  In Emacs Doom, use `SPC m q` to assign a tag to the given headline. In Org Mode, headlines inherit tags from their parent headlines. They are also two ways of search for headlines by using tags. You can use org-agenda's tags search triggered by the `SPC o a m` which displays the results in a separate buffer; or, you can generate a sparse tree with the given tag by using `org-sparse-tree` or `org-tags-sparse-tree` functions.

  Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.

  Org Mode allows to set priorities for tasks headlines. By default the priority marker goes from A (the highest priority), through B (the medium priority) to C (the lowest priority). In Org Mode, the priority marker is called the priority cookie. Priorities can be attached to any headline, this doesn't have to be a task.

  A task/todo headline without the priority is equal to a headline with the B priority. Priorities are useful only in the agenda context. The highest priority tasks are displayed first either in the agenda view or in the agenda tasks.

  You can change the priority cookie color using the `org-priority-faces` variable. It is a list of priorities from the highest to the lowest with the ASCII code and corresponding color. There is also an external package called `org-fancy-priorites` which allows to change the look of the priority cookie.

  Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.

  Org Mode is incredibly versatile. It not only allows to create and store notes, but it also provides a comprehensive task management functionalities.

  With Org Mode you have flexibilty how you manage yours tasks. Those tasks can be included in your notes or spread across many files. Each file can be dedicated to a specific project or area of activity.

  By default, tasks in Org Mode come with two statuses TODO for open tasks and DONE for closed tasks. It is easy, however, to define your own task statuses using the org-todo-keywords variable.

  Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.

  Org Mode headlines are created with the asterisk sign.

  Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.

  Org Mode allows to include code snippets. There are special #+BEGIN_SRC and #+END_SRC markers for that. Out of the box Org Mode supports many popular languages. For the lesser known programming languages there is a plethora of plugins to make it work. The snippets are automatically highlighted. It is also possible to conveniently edit them in a separate buffer.

  This feature is similar to other editors, especially the ones supporting Markdown. What sets Org Mode and Emacs apart is that the code snippets can be executed right inside an Org document. Not only that, the block of texts outside of the snippets can provide the input data and the result of each snippet can be chained.

  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.

  Org Mode headlines are created with the asterisk sign.

  Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.

  Today, let's dive into the Emacs configuration by adjusting some Org Mode related settings. In order to link to particular words, there is a special variable `org-link-search-must-match-exact-headline`, when set to `nil` you will be able to target words using links, otherwise only links to headlines are possible. Additionally, you can quickly store or bookmark locations for any headline using `SPC n l`. Later, when creating a link, it's just a matter of selecting a particular bookmark from the selection list.

  Org documents can be connected using links. There are two types of links in Org Mode: internal and external links. Internal links target headlines in a particular document while external links can not only link between Org documents and files, but also target resources on the web. This can as simple as an HTTP link, but there are different link types as well. Org documents can references Emacs Lisp scripts, Shell commands, Usenet groups and many, many more.

  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.

  Avy is an Emacs package for jumping to visible text using a char-based decision tree. It is similar to ace-jump-mode and vim-easymotion.

  Avy allows to use the search mechanic to efficiently move to another place within the visible area. In other words, you choose the place that you want the cursor to be and with a search for a word followed by a label selection, you quickly jump there. Avy is one of the most powerful packages in Emacs that provide such text-jumping functionality.

  Once you get used to Avy, it is almost as if you can move the cursor using your eyes, just by looking where you want it to be placed.

  Introduction to buffers, windows with a short demo of basic navigation in Emacs.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.

  In this video I describe the installation, configuration, and usage of my primary text editor: Spacemacs (http://spacemacs.org/). This editor is a kit for the venerable Emacs text editor and is very suitable for programming, especially when dealing with large complex code bases.

  Disclaimer: This tutorial assumes you know the basics of navigating code in Vim. If you do not, consider watching a video on the subject (this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxET5r3Xc3g is pretty good).

  Note: it was pointed out to me that I forgot to go over how to create a new file. You can do it vim style ( :e filepath ) or if you try to visit a non existing file in the SPC f f menu it'll create a new file for you.

  A step-by-step talk from Dr. Carsten Dominik on how to use Org-mode to organize one's life as a scientist.

  Org-mode combines many organizational tasks into one application including an expandable outliner, a to-do system, note taking, code documentation and execution, and document creation.  This effectively encompasses the functionality of workflowy, OneNote/Evernote,  jupyter/ipython notebooks, and your favorite to-do app all in one place.

  If you are interesting in trying org-mode you can get installation instructions here: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html#orgb836ac0

  Or visit the main page here: https://orgmode.org

  Note: Org-mode is an application or 'mode' in Emacs. I personally recommend using Spacemacs to run Org-mode as it is more user friendly than stock emacs.  To avoid confusion, select emacs mode when setting up spacemacs.

  To start off the new series, I thought it would be a good idea to go on a quest to find the best text editor to use for our web design. I don’t know why I thought that was a good idea, but I did. In this video we’re messing around with Emacs, a fancy little gadget that resides within your Terminal. I’m not an expert on the tool, but I know we can use it to write HTML & CSS, so that’s what we’re going to do today.

  Unfortunately the speaker's microphone was off so we had to use audio from two separate sources in the audio. This means the audio quality is not great, and also there is an 18 minute gap in the middle.

    By default Emacs tries to guess the Paragraph direction for bidi-text.
    This ends up with mixed up looking buffers.

  This screencast shows how to create a simple Java application using test driven development (TDD). That is: write the tests FIRST, then implement the actual code. Refactor. Then do the same thing all over again.

  The screencast also shows that Emacs is now, thanks to lsp-mode, dap-mode, yasnippets and many others, an excellent Java editor. My configuration can be found here: https://github.com/skybert/my-little-friends/tree/master/emacs

      than remembering 100s of bindings for smartparens.

  Old hacker, new to Emacs, and starting to Grok. Got this tplink "smart plug" piece of insecure kit for my wife to run the coffee maker from an app. Well the app is huge and I don't want it on my phone. A quick google search and I can control it from a terminal. But who wants to leave emacs?

  I've never written something like this before, and it's only my second thing to write in elisp, so I didn't really expect to hack it out in an hour before work by only reverse engineering the yahoo weather mode line widget and built in help commands... Because it actually took 90 minutes...

  Title: Org-mode and other useful things in Emacs

  Abstract:
  "Org-mode" is a built-in feature in the Emacs text editor. It has been the bedrock of the way I organize my workflow for the last 5 years. In my talk, I will be showcasing:
  - Org-mode's tree structure for information storage and access
  - its spreadsheet capability
  - some basic Lisp for in-buffer computations
  - integration with Jupyter notebooks
  and much more!

  This is a re-recording of a talk I held about Org-mode, literate programming and Emacs at Zenuity (https://www.zenuity.com/). The aim was to provide a live presentation which showcases some of the many possibilities that Org-mode offers. Giving the viewer more an overall picture but also offer some deeper dives of Emacs and elisp features.

  I would also like to give a lot of credit to Henrik Lissner's Doom https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs. The configuration is nothing but awesome and I have learned a lot from him during my time as an Emacs user.

  GNU Emacs for all
  Having using GNU Emacs for more that 6 years now and doing Python development for equal amount of time I’d like to share my experience with this great GNU software which has been for 30 years. I’d like to go through how I use Emacs for almost all my tasks like note taking, agenda, LaTeX, reveal.js presentations, IDE, and IRC. In this talk I’ll demonstrate how Emacs can be configured to do all such thing without a need to a dedicated application for each specific task. I’ll also talk about how to maintain Emacs configurations using org-mode and literate programming.

  John Miller offers an overview of the Emacs IPython Notebook (EIN), a full-featured client for the Jupyter Notebook in Emacs, and shares a brief history of its development. John covers the features of EIN that make it uniquely Emacs—starting and automatically logging into a Jupyter server from inside Emacs, connecting Python buffers to a running kernel, allowing for interactive evaluation, org-mode Babel support, Emacs debugger integration, and company-mode and Jedi auto-complete integration. John then explains how he uses EIN in his own work, with a simple case study of troubleshooting activity decline of highly chlorided alumina catalyst in a pentane isomerization chemical process.

  Adrien Brochard demonstrates a different way to Emacs: combining Emacs and Linux as a virtualized IDE to work on any machine. It includes a collection of bash script that automates the build of a dev environment and a set of literate Emacs config files which takes care of replicating packages and settings. And if we're lucky all of this will build in less time than he needs to read through the code!

  Org-mode, a mode within the Emacs text editor, provides a vast array of features that are useful for anyone working in technical fields. In addition to offering tools for indirect "work" (e.g. emails, todos, time tracking, contacts, journasls/logs, etc.), Org-mode presents a nice environment for reproducible research, literate programming, and document creation. This talk will provide an overview of said features, focusing briefly on tools for indirect work with a more dedicated look/demo at how Org-mode can be used for data analysis (with R as the primary language), interspersing prose and executable code, and the ability to export documents in multiple formats (pdf, html, md, etc.).

  ======================================

  Abstract: At this TechChat, we'll take a look at spacemacs, a popular new configuration for the emacs editor. This provides, amongst other things, a near-identical replication of vim within emacs. Seasoned vim users can access unparalleled configurability and extendability of emacs, without the need to learn new keybindings for editing. The configuration is designed to make emacs easily discoverable and make common configurations simple. Vanilla emacs users can have the convenience of simple modular configuration, whilst taking advantage of a powerful modular configuration and switching between vim and emacs style with a single keystroke.

  Lean back and relax while enjoying a deep dive into the wonderful world of the Emacs editor. Emacs renaissance came with the advent of Clojure and undoubtedly is the most popular editor among Clojurians today. Of course there is a lot more you can do with Emacs, but much like playing an instrument, great skill only comes with practice.

  You neither need to be an Emacs user nor a Clojure programmer and neither do you need to contemplate about becoming one either to enjoy this talk. Much like you don't become a professional musician by attending a concert, but it might very well be inspiring.

  This talk was recorded at the Clojure Meetup in Zurich, Switzerland (organised by 200ok.ch).

  Make a simple hello-world webserver using Chicken Scheme. This screencast shows how you can go about this, with many of the practicalities of using a REPL in Emacs, Chicken Scheme threads and a webserver API.

  The main focus is on workflow: The interpreter is started, and you build up your program incrementally as it's running. When you're done, you save, compile and "deploy".

  Content:
  - REPL basics: send code surrounding the cursor to an interpreter
  - Spawning and terminating srfi-18 threads interactively
  - Webserver API: spiffy
  - Compiling your result

  Ivy, Counsel, and Swiper are great if you can figure out how to use them! Luckily they are all pretty simple. In fact, you can just... install them and copy/paste some stuff and be on your way! I wanted to understand these emacs packages though, and that's a little more challenging.

  Ivy is a package that helps you search. It helps you do things in M-x, or find file, and Dired, etc... Anything where you look for something in Emacs, Ivy can come to the rescue and help you type less.

  For example. Let's say I want to look through some Melpa packages. No longer do I have to type package-list-packages.  Instead, I can just type "pa li packa"  and Ivy will find all the results that match the search terms. Using spaces, you can target certain parts of what you're looking for. It just helps you type less.

  Ivy doesn't rely on anything, but Swiper will automatically pull in Ivy when it's installed, because Swiper needs Ivy. Swiper does the same thing as Ivy, but replaces isearch, so you can use ivy features when searching through text.

  Counsel gives you extra functions that aren't normally available. For example: You can open a buffer or file in a new window.

  These packages integrate with a LOT of other emacs packages, so it's really

* Emacs Super Fast Frame/Window Switching with FrameMove & WindMove

  1:51 - FrameMove with Arrows
  3:55 - Hook FrameMove & WindMove together
  6:00 - Move with VIM bindings!!



  In this video you'll learn how to quickly switch between Windows and Frames using the packages "FrameMove" and "WindMove".

  The problem with the default Emacs configuration is that switching between frames and windows is slow and inefficient.

  Switching to a new Emacs Frame by default uses the command C-x 5 0,  and switching between windows is C-x o, and when you use C-x o you have to go through a loop.

  By using Windmove and framemove you can setup intuitive and efficient keybindings to quickly move between windows and frames.

  Most people setup windmove and framemove to cycle between windows using the arrow keys along with a modifier key like "Shift". This is a significant improvement upon the default because you can switch between emacs windows & frames using the arrow keys.

  Instead of being limited to forward and backward, you can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT, which can dramatically improve your speed.

  Unfortunately, the arrow keys are too far away. Any good programmer will keep his or her hands on the keyboard as much as possible, and not waste their time reaching for the arrow keys unless necessary.

  Luckily, there's a simple improvement to allow you to switch between Emacs windows and frames even quicker.  By editing your .emacs configuration, you can adjust the windmove and framemove shortcuts to be bound to the keys "H", "J", "K", and "L".

  If you look closely, you'll notice those keys are right under your fingers when you're typing, so it's much easier and faster to move between frames and windows!

  How to grab "bootstrap glyphicon list" using mozilla/firefox and emacs/multiple-cursors:

  1. Copy outer html from inspect element.
  2. Yank it into emacs/web-mode buffer. (another mode is fine)
  3. c-x h to select all text in buffer.
  4. m-x mc/mark-all-in-region-regexp &lt;enter&gt;.
  5. Mark regexp in region: "glyphicon glyphicon-[a-z-]*" &lt;enter&gt;.
  6. c-w to cut all marked text. (it's a little lack on my computer)
  7. Waiting until done.
  8. c-g c-g to deactivate multiple-cursors.
  9. c-x h del to clear the buffer.
  10. c-x r y to yank the list.

  Notes:
  c-x = &lt;ctrl&gt;-x
  m-x = &lt;alt&gt;-x
  c-w = &lt;ctrl&gt;-w
  c-g = &lt;ctrl&gt;-g

  Here are the instructions to install Racket, and configure Emacs to run Scheme. Just follow steps 1-8 :
  1.) Copy and paste the text (at the BOTTOM of this page) in your .emacs file
  (note: you can access .emacs by using keyboard macros C-x C-f (this means ctrl+x ctrl +f) then type ~/.emacs in mini-buffer)
  2.) On the last line, make sure it says "mzscheme" instead of "scm"
  3.) Save file
  4.) Download Racket
      - just type "sudo apt-get install racket" in the command prompt
  5.) Create your first scheme program and save it
  6.) Run Scheme process (this is done in emacs text editor)
        - "M-x run-scheme"
  7.) You are now using racket interpreter, load your scheme program by typing:
        -  "load [your_program_name.scm]" (note: brackets are not required)
  8.) Now you're ready to go

  sources:
  http://racket-lang.org/


  ======== COPY/PASTE EVERYTHING BELOW INTO YOUR EMACS CONFIG FILE =========

  ;;; Always do syntax highlighting
  (global-font-lock-mode 1)

  ;;; Also highlight parens

  ;;; This is the binary name of my scheme implementation
  (setq scheme-program-name "mzscheme")

  Sprecher: Florian Over
  Emacs ist weit mehr als ein Editor, in seinem Ökosystem haben sich mittlerweile zahlreiche nützliche Werkzeuge etabliert, wovon das bekannteste vermutlich der org-mode ist. org-mode hilft bei der Organisation der täglichen Notizen und Todos, und sind die Keybindings einmal im Muskelgedächtnis verankert geschieht dies rasend schnell. Florian Over von axxessio zeigt uns die ersten Schritte mit org-mode.

  Hello! In this video you will learn how to use some of Emacs basic functionalities.

  This video covers:
  1. Creation of directories/folders
  2. Creation of files
  3. How to obtain spilt view (horizontally and vertically)
  4. Switch between files (using keyboard and mouse)

  Thanks for watching this video! :)

  There is quite a discussion on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/54pxp1/emacs_is_hurting_clojure/) due to a post about Emacs hurting Clojure. The idea being that it is too difficult to get started with both Emacs and Clojure. So, I explore what needs to be done to start from absolute zero to a productive Clojure environment.

  Hint: it needs some work from the community. I will turn this video into a blog post as well with a getting started guide.

  To grab the source code, hop over to https://github.com/howardabrams/dot-files/blob/master/emacs-eshell.org#shell-there

  I promised that I would give the source to the function that populates the map of hosts and their IP address. Keep in mind, you could just hard-code those values if you wish (as it is just a hash-table). However, this is what I wrote to call to an OpenStack system to populate that hashmap, so to see that, check out this gist: https://gist.github.com/howardabrams/e7237b6bbd9e84bcc353bde13213576a

  "Org mode is an outliner, markup language, task manager, calendar, contact manager, and who-knows-what-else. I use it to write documents and presentations, manage my todo list, and I even write my Emacs configuration in it.

  In other words, Org is taking over my life.

  I’ll be introducing some of the functionality of Org, demonstrating what it can do, and showing how you, too, can become pleasantly obsessed with a wacky, overgrown outlining tool."

  In this screencast, I show you how to rewrite git history by rewording commit messages, reordering and squashing commits together, and finally by breaking open larger commits into smaller ones, all with Emacs and magit.

  Erratum: At one point I call the at-sign an ampersand. I'm really sorry about that.

  You should definitely also checkout Howard Abrams's magit demonstration, it's super well done: https://youtu.be/vQO7F2Q9DwA

  Generating outputs (plots, tables, and texts) is an essential part of scientific research. Usually they are generated with scripts (either .py or.ipynb`), and a natural way of maintaining these scripts is using either a long script file or multiple short files.

  When one has to update these outputs, the usual workflow is: 1) find the file(s) and code block(s) inside the file that contains the code for output generation, 2) re-learn what you did so you can edit the code, and 3) run the code to generate new outputs.

  Each of these steps has a cognitive overhead (non-fluency), which hampers your productivity, especially if it has been a while since you looked at them. Using IPython Notebook facilitates some of the procedures but it does not solve everything.

  In this talk, I introduce org-mode and some of its functionalities for all three steps. org-mode is ideal for managing these tasks because it can minimize the non-fluency. It has a convenient and flexible markup syntax for hierarchical documents. It uses tree-like headlines, which make it very easy to organize code and text. It provides a convenient way to collapse or expand headline blocks and navigate through them. In addition, one can execute a code block or export the results (or the source code itself) conveniently inside org-mode. Theoretically, one can have the entire contents and code for a paper and a presentation inside one org file. I show examples of how one can leverage these functionalities to maintain outputs.

  Emacs allows you to input characters that might not be on your keyboard or available through your operating system's input methods.

  Commands introduced:

  M-x set-input-method
  M-x describe-input-method
  C-\
  C-q
  C-x =
  C-u C-x =

  Note that for languages that use Chinese characters, completions are likely to be much better with a dedicated input method.

* Searching the Web with engine-mode

  I probably spend about 75% of my programming time looking up documentation. That's really easy in Emacs Lisp--my documentation is built into my editor--but in most other languages I'm not so lucky.

  I wrote engine-mode to help fix this problem. It's a simple minor mode that lets me define arbitrary search engines and send snippets of text to them from within Emacs. Now I don't have to copy and paste text between my browser and editor! So fancy.

  We'll be talking about how to get started with engine-mode (it's easy!) and then digging into the implementation and discussing the process of committing a package to MELPA.

  In this Emacs Chat, Steve Purcell shares how he got started with Emacs by using a Vim emulation mode, what it's like to give hundreds of package authors feedback on Emacs Lisp style, and how he's eventually replacing himself with Emacs Lisp (flycheck-package). He also highlights useful packages for managing buffers of version-controlled files (ibuffer-vc), working with lines if the region isn't active (whole-line-or-region), or maximizing certain buffers (full-frame).

  The amazing Emacs org-mode has myriad uses and features including outlining, note-taking, table management, and publishing to HTML and LaTeX. It’s also a fabulous tool to help make your research reproducible. From Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research):
  In 2012, a survey done for Nature found that 47 out of 53 medical research papers on the subject of cancer were irreproducible (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html)… Researchers explained in a 2006 study that, of 249 data sets from American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 73% of contacted authors did not respond with their data (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17032082) over a 6-month period.

  Org-mode allows authors to include their datasets and all programs that were run to generate figures and text. Included files can be used to facilitate version control. While there are limits to this approach—including data generation and software versioning—it represents a big advance in reproducibility and one which has not yet been widely adopted.

  Richard Stallman will speak about the goals and philosophy of the Free Software Movement, and the status and history of the GNU operating system, which in combination with the kernel Linux is now used by tens of millions of users world-wide.

  I corsi di laurea in Ingegneria Informatica (L8 e LM32), nell'ambito delle attività di supporto alla didattica, hanno organizzato un incontro con R. Stallman, una delle figure di maggiore rilievo sia tecnicno che storico dell'informatica moderna. Richard Matthew Stallman è il principale esponente del movimento del software libero. Nel settembre del 1983 diede avvio al progetto GNU con l'intento di creare un sistema operativo simile a Unix ma composto interamente da software libero[: da ciò prese vita il movimento del software libero. Nell'ottobre del 1985 fondò la Free Software Foundation (FSF).

  Keyboard macros are a powerful Emacs feature! A keyboard macro is simply a recording of a sequence of key sequences that can be played back and repeated. In this meetup we go over the different keyboard macro commands Emacs has to offer; and in the second half we solve a couple repetitive text manipulation tasks using them.

  Se Christian og Magnar parprogrammere på nettspill med Clojure og ClojureScript.

  Så du ZombieTDD for et par år siden? Magnar og Christian er tilbake med ZombieCLJ - en norsk videoserie med Clojure og ClojureScript. De setter seg ned med emacsen og parprogrammerer en ny episode foran publikum. Det blir utvikling av en ny feature, så du kan henge med selv om du ikke har sett alle episodene. Se hvordan to typer som digger funksjonell programmering angriper problemer og skriver tester.


  Magnar Sveen

  Jeg heter Magnar og er en glad framsieutvikler. Jeg er deleier i Kodemaker, jobber til daglig som konsulent, og om kvelden utvikler jeg blant annet eventyrspillet Adventur Delux, pomodoro-verktøyet mytomatoes.com og en screencast om at emacs rocker. Jeg har også en blogg med screencasts om testdrevet javascript, zombier og mafia på zombietdd.com. Og en til med Clojure og ClojureScript på www.zombieclj.no

  Christian Johansen

  Christian is a passionate programmer at Kodemaker.

  He is the author of Test-Driven JavaScript Development, and he maintains several open source projects, including the recently released test-framework Buster.JS and the popular mocking framework Sinon.JS.

  After dark you may find him tinkering with his Emacs setup, coding Lisp and slowly being devoured by the world of functional programming.

  Perry Metzger has been using Emacs as his text editor since early September, 1983 -- nearly 31 years. Over much of that time, it has also been his primary way to read email, compile programs, and perform a variety of other tasks.

  Why would anyone use a single program for that long? This talk is partially intended to answer that question.

  Emacs remains one of the most important user interfaces (and text editors) for computer professionals almost 40 years after it was created. The talk is intended to be part history, part philosophy, and part speculation on the future. It will also teach Emacs fans how to explain to their skeptical friends why it is still a good idea to learn a tool from the terminal era that requires memorization of dozens of control sequences in an age of GUIs and smart phones.

  Emacs can be a powerful tool in organizing your life, but it can be a little intimidating if you are just getting started. I hope that this tutorial shows you that with only a few simple commands you can easily organize your thoughts and keep track of everything you need to do. You don’t need to know Emacs inside and out to take advantage of Org-Mode, and even if you only use emacs to manage your to-do list, I think you will find that the time you spent learning the program is a worthwile investment.

  Ray Puzio shows us his implementation of turtle graphics in emacs and takes us under the shell to see how it works.

  Turtle graphics are a way of drawing pictures in which one provides a series of directions such as "move forward" or "turn left" to steer the pen. (The name comes from the fact that the original implementation involved a robotic turtle as an output device controlled by the computer.) In addition to providing a useful and entertaining program, this talk also discusses techniques of pbm graphics and the use of a buffer for drawing which are of general use when doing graphics in emacs.

  Many developers have gotten used to powerful tools such as IDE's on other platforms. For Erlang developers emacs can have as much or more power by combining emacs lisp and distel with native Erlang code. I will use the integration of Rebar, eunit to show how to build powerful tools in Emacs to make Erlang development more productive and more fun.

  TDD is part of a modern work flow, and using +eunit+ with +rebar+ and +emacs+ can greatly enhance the developer's day to day experience. I will show how to have emacs run rebar eunit tests Automatically when the user saves a file.

  In addition with some elisp emacs can be used to show code coverage in the editor so you can now where your tests are covering and not covering code.

  Talk objectives: This talk will aim to empower users to build custom tools to integrate emacs and Erlang development. While the examples will focus around TDD it will really be about how to build cool tools in Emacs.

  Target audience: I expect this talk will appeal to mid level programmers. Some knowledge of Erlang is expected. In addition the audience should be familiar with emacs and TDD as well as Erlang.

  Internet Relay Chat (IRC) has been a popular P2P messaging system since 1988. Since it uses a text-based interface, it's a perfect fit for Emacs! We'll be looking at ERC, the built-in Emacs IRC client and the solution to all our social needs. ERC easily fits into anyone's workflow and has tons of libraries to make it even more seamless.

  Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/

  About the talk:
  The term "programming language" is often used to describe the medium we use to build software. However, to what extent can we also consider programming languages as interfaces in their own right? Are they sufficiently expressive, interactive and dynamic to, say, control a musical instrument? What if the programming language was the musical instrument? How might that challenge our perception of programming language and tools in general. For example, what happens when we consider the act of programming as a performance? What might a music programming environment which has sufficient liveness, rapid feedback and tolerance of failure look like? What benefits would such a style of programming offer business? Could live coding be beneficial for rapid prototyping, exploring big data sets, and even communicating formal business ideas?
  Weaving Immutable Data Structures into Ephemeral Sounds - Conference Party

  Armed with laptops, monomes and number of simple MIDI Kontrollers, we harness the full power of the SuperCollider synthesis engine through the incredible Overtone platform. We don't just use our laptops to tweak GUI sliders and pots, we write raw Clojure code into Emacs live in our performances. We also generate real-time visualisations perfectly synchronised to the sound with Quil and Shadertone. All the code for our sets is open source and available for you to play with: Meta-eX Ignite.

  Live Hacking allows us to generate music on-the-fly enabling us to change the direction of the sound and respond to our environment at a whim. Our sounds aren't pre-recorded and tweaked on-stage, they're coded and generated live in real time. We produce a real raw noise rather than manufactured industry-polished pseudo-perfection. Our sound isn't hardcore, breakcore or speedcore - it's multi-core and fully hyper-threaded.

  2) Extempore running inside Nao's brain!  (ssh shell into Nao's Extempore brain on laptop screen - left)
  3) Emacs running on Laptop remotely connected to Nao's Extempore brain
  4) All audio coming from Nao's "ears" - you'll need to listen carefully.

  Unfortunately we only had time to get Nao to speak and generate an audio signal (white noise in this brief video), but everything is now in place to do some really interesting things with Extempore on the Nao. Extempore is running natively on Nao's Atom processor with full on-the-fly native code compilation, so really the sky is the limit.

  Big thanks to Quinton Anderson for providing the Nao!  I'm sure that Quinton will post some (hopefully in focus) videos of his Extempore powered Nao doing much cooler things when he gets the chance.

  1,000+ packages of extra functionality are available for Emacs through ELPA and MELPA. Let's install some and test them out. I'll install the solarized theme and then play around with nyan-mode which gives us a much more colorful scrollbar.

  Commands introduced in this video:

  M-x list-packages
  M-x customize-group
  M-x package-initialize or (package-initialize)
  M-x nyan-mode

  Note that the melpa package is no longer available and is unnecessary. You can just skip installing it.

  Track: Reproducible Science

  We will discuss the use of emacs + org-mode + python in enabling reproducible research. This combination of software enables researchers to intertwine narrative and mathematical text with figures and code that is executable within a document, with capture of the output. Portions of the document can be selectively exported to LaTeX, HTML, pdf and other other formats. We have used this method to produce technical manuscripts submitted for peer review in scientific journals, in the preparation of two e-books (about 300 pages each) on using python in scientific and engineering applications (http://jkitchin.github.com/pycse), and in using python in the modeling of the properties of materials with density functional theory (http://jkitchin.github.com/dft-book), as well as a python-powered blog at http://jkitchin.github.com. Our experience suggests all three components are critical for enabling reproducible research in practice: an extensible editor, a markup language that separates text, math, data and code, and an effective language such as python. We will show examples of the pros and cons of this particular implementation of editor/markup/code combination.

  Tavis RuddTwo years ago I developed a case of Emacs Pinkie (RSI) so severe my hands went numb and I could no longer type or work. Desperate, I tried voice recognition. At first programming with it was painfully slow but, as I couldn't type, I persevered. After several months of vocab tweaking and duct-tape coding in Python and Emacs Lisp, I had a system that enabled me to code faster and more efficiently by voice than I ever had by hand.

  In a fast-paced live demo, I will create a small system using Python, plus a few other languages for good measure, and deploy it without touching the keyboard. The demo gods will make a scheduled appearance. I hope to convince you that voice recognition is no longer a crutch for the disabled or limited to plain prose. It's now a highly effective tool that could benefit all programmers.

  I created an addon for emacs + org-protocol that helps me fixing code reviews that people send on github.

  When you're looking at a comment in the github interface, you have to change to your editor, and remember a file (possibly with its path), and the relevant line to go and fix your stuff.

  With this mode, your browser will tell emacs the information so you'll just have to hack away.

  Are you comfortable passing functions around, returning them from other functions, and generally enjoy the pleasures of higher-order functions? Join in on an hour implementing ideas from functional programming in JavaScript. I will show you how you can significantly up your game by leaving loops behind and embracing functions as the primary unit of abstraction.

  Christian Johansen

  Christian is a passionate programmer currently working at gitorious.org where he does everything from JavaScript to Ruby to Unix systems tuning. He is the author of "Test-Driven JavaScript Development", and he maintains several open source projects, including the recently released test-framework Buster.JS and the popular mocking framework Sinon.JS. After dark you may find him tinkering with his Emacs setup, coding Lisp and slowly being devoured by the world of functional programming.

  I liberated myself from Wordpress to a simple setup using Emacs, Orgmode, some custom Ruby and elisp to generate my blog/website as static html. Makes blogging more enjoyable and low-threshold.

  My emacs setup (also org-mode based!) can be found at https://github.com/thomanil/dot-emacs . The actual conversion is done by org-publish (https://github.com/thomanil/kjeldahlnilsson.net/blob/master/html-export.el), which I run in batch-mode from a small Rakefile (https://github.com/thomanil/kjeldahlnilsson.net/blob/master/Rakefile) - so I can regen my blog from the command line. My blog-{new,generate,deploy} elisp commands simply shell out to that Rake script. Automatic browser reload is done with the Firefox Auto Reload plugin. Finally, note that each regen of the blog takes a while since everything is recreated every time - will fix when I have time and inclination.

  A bit rough and hacky, but it works. :)

  "Emacs has traditionally been the editor with the best Erlang support. Distel, created by Luke Gorrie et al in 2002, provides an implementation of the Erlang distribution protocol in emacs lisp.  Enabling communication between an Erlang emulator and emacs enables all kinds of cool tricks.
  Since this is the 10-year anniversary of Distel, I (the current maintainer) thought it fitting to present the current state of Distel. Which, in my unbiased opinion, is still the state of the art of Erlang editing. "

  Please note - this process is now outdated. Read the Overtone wiki documentation for the latest install process: http://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/

  This screencast will walk you through the process of installing all the various parts necessary to allow you to hack on Overtone from Emacs.

  It covers the following topics:

  * Installing Emacs
  * Installing Slime
  * Installing Cake
  * Installing Swank Server
  * Creating a new Overtone Project
  * Hacking in Emacs

  By the end of this screencast, you'll have your own Emacs-powered Overtone environment to play in.

  For those interested, the initial slides were presented with Apple's Keynote, and the terminal interface was a combination of the excellent iTerm2 (http://www.iterm2) and dvtm (http://www.brain-dump.org/projects/dvtm/). The specific version of dvtm used in this screencast is available here: github.com/samaaron/dvtm

  A simple example of additive synthesis. The synth initially consists of 5 randomly panned sine waves each at multiples of 100 hz with a decaying volume which is randomly modulated.

  This is controlled via a custom monome app which allows for the representation of the "speed" value within defined upper and lower bounds in addition to volume and a number of predefined pitches.

  The top row of the monome is a binary representation of the seed value: 1 -> 256. This seed value is then mapped onto the range defined by the upper and lower bounds.

  The 3rd row (again 1 -> 256) multipled by the 4th row which represents a power of 10: -3 -> 4 represents the upper bound. The 6th and 7th rows similarly define the lower bound.

  The 2nd row defines a number of predefined pitch triggers, the 5th row updates the running synths with new speed values and the 8th row defines the volume of the next triggered synth.

  This is an ongoing series of simple experiments using Overtone to produce sound and maybe one day music.

Finally, the viewer is shown how a simple musical sequence may be composed and then converted into an intricate Reich phase. The main body of the video was recorded in one take and features an Emacs buffer (using Emacs Live http://overtone.github.io/emacs-live/) for editing text and communicating with Overtone (http://overtone.github.io/), an expressive Clojure front-end to SuperCollider. Clojure is a state-of-the-art functional lisp emphasising immutability and concurrency (http://clojure.org).

  This is not a "performance" or a general introduction.  Instead it is a somewhat congested, and probably confusing, introduction to some of the more technical aspects of Extempore.  In particular concurrency, the compiler, audio signal processing, and runtime binding to dynamic libraries.

  It's almost certainly premature to be making screencasts with Extempore, however, I've thrown this together because, as they say, a screencast is worth a thousand words.

  The audio is slightly out of sink but this shouldn't cause to much trouble for this introductory video.

  In this screencast Extempore is running in Emacs under Ubuntu Linux.

  Emacs with orgtbl mode used to create a HTML table.

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7rioYkAsrA is a higher resolution version of this video with commentary included.

  http://dynamic-thinking.blogspot.com/2009/11/orgtbl-mode.html has a nice write-up inspired (?) by this video.

  Creating HTML tables by hand can be painful, however thanks to orgtbl mode (which comes with org mode) Emacs users can edit tables in friendly way and later "send" (as org mode calls it) the data into a HTML source code. Inserting new columns and rearranging them is a single key binding!

  What makes org (and orgtbl) mode even more powerful is the spreadsheet capabilities.  You can define formula which will be used to calculate values of given cell or a group of cells (ie. a column).  And because the underlying evaluation mechanism is Emacs' calc mode you can calculate almost anything! That includes integrals, differentials and Taylor's functions!

  What else has been shown on the video is the spell checker and auto completion.

  ABSTRACT

   Org-mode is a large Emacs sub-systems that has been integrated into
   Emacs with the version 22.1 release. From it original intend,
   Org-mode is a system for structured note-taking and project planning.
   It uses strictly plain text files, making it a truly portable,
   system-independent solution. The project-planning features are
   implemented using a fairly simple outlining paradigm, upon which
   meta-data concepts like due dates, priorities, TODO states and tags
   are overlayed in a non-intrusive way. Besides outlining the system
   and its basic concepts, I will give background information into the
   history of Org-mode and discuss the properties of such an evolved
   system compared to a top-down designed one. Finally, I will also
   briefly touch on some technical aspects that may be interesting for
   Emacs wizards and developers.
