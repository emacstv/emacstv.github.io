  Oops! üòÖ Sometimes things go wrong. We equip our package to gracefully handle API errors from OpenAI. Whether it's a wrong model or a connection hiccup, we catch these errors, display meaningful messages, and log them for future reference. This makes our integration robust and reliable.

  Now that we can send prompts, we want to see responses immediately! üëÄ We tweak our functions so that once ChatGPT replies, the *chatgpt[requests]* buffer pops up automatically. No more hunting for responses ‚Äï we get them right where we need them, enhancing our workflow efficiency.

      <title>Prot Asks: PizzaTorque about Emacs for programming, linguistics, art and community</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g8o0M9CRkA</link>
      <guid>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g8o0M9CRkA</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g8o0M9CRkA">youtube</a><br><br>In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More here: https://protesilaos.com/prot-asks/.

  Today I learn from PizzaTorque about how Emacs is used for programming in the field of data science. We discuss the kind of infrastructure Emacs has for dealing with various programming languages and how the experience is. Emacs as a note-taking tool is also something we consider. Then the discussion shifts to linguistics and relevant cultural as well as political considerations. We frequently draw parallels with Emacs. After that we talk about Emacs more in terms of lifestyle and art, commenting on how it helps us develop certain qualities that apply to other parts of our life. We conclude with a conversation on community and an individual's outlook, tying it all together.

  PizzaTorque does video streams on programming-related topics, while using Emacs. Here is the YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@PizzaTorque</div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HycaJwHqs5M">youtube</a><br><br>You open your terminal, full of hope.
  But before you write one line of code‚Ä¶ you enter the editor warzone.

  Vim, Emacs, VS Code, Sublime, NeoVim, Nano ‚Äî every dev has a favorite.
  And every dev thinks you‚Äôre wrong.

  In this chaotic (and painfully accurate) breakdown, we cover:

  Vim: the cryptic keybinding dungeon

  Emacs: the text editor that does your taxes

  VS Code: the plugin playground of the people

  Sublime: the eternal "Unregistered" champ

  NeoVim: where configuration is the final boss

  Nano: the DevOps death trap no one escapes

  Browser editors in 2025: code from inside a Docker container‚Ä¶ inside another Docker container

  Whether you're flexing a 12ms NeoVim startup or still clicking ‚ÄòLater‚Äô on Sublime‚Äôs license prompt, just remember:

  ‚ö° The most powerful key in programming is still Ctrl+S.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Prot Asks: James about teaching biology, Emacs, and free software politics</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzVToImIm1Y</link>
      <guid>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzVToImIm1Y</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzVToImIm1Y">youtube</a><br><br>In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More here: https://protesilaos.com/prot-asks/.

  In this 1-hour video, I learn from James about what goes into teaching biology and thinking as a scientist. We discuss the shortcomings of the education system and touch on the alternative approach of going more in-depth. James describes how Emacs comes into the picture, the importance of the free software community---and community in general---and how politics informs our views on competition and cooperation.

      <title>Prot Asks: Rudy about Emacs for game development, Lisp hacking, and learning</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eC1kgq4mzA">youtube</a><br><br>In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!).

More information in the announcement I posted: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2025-07-10-prot-asks-chats-videos-proposal/.

  For this meeting, I learnt from Rudy about a bunch of geeky and fun issues. We discussed what it means to be "living in Emacs". It takes a certain mindset to experiment with your tools and to understand what is going on. You eventually push against the boundaries because you take things to their full potential. Our talk covers bugs and some in-development feature of Org mode. Then we explore more themes that speak to the hacker's heart: Scheme and Fennel for developing games within certain constraints, simple cooking, experimenting with pizza, and more!</div>]]></description>

The topics cover anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More information in the announcement I posted: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2025-07-10-prot-asks-chats-videos-proposal/.

  Today I learnt from Ihor Radchenko what kind of work goes into maintaining the Emacs Org package. We discussed the process of contributing to Org and how the community is involved in the process. Other than the technicalities of Emacs, I asked Ihor about general interests in life. Some of those involve the study of history, which we explored in some further depth. Ihor has travelled and worked in various parts of the planet. I wanted to understand more about those experiences. Towards the end of our meeting, I wanted to gain insights into what "material science" is in practice.

  More from Ihor listed on my website because the description here limits the character count: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2025-07-26-prot-asks-ihor-emacs-org-maintainer-history-travel-material-science</div>]]></description>

      <title>C++ development in Emacs: clangd and eglot</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRLzS0_8MBQ</link>
      <guid>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRLzS0_8MBQ</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRLzS0_8MBQ">youtube</a><br><br>Here's how to set up Emacs for a better C++ development experience, in my opinion.

  clangd install instructions https://clangd.llvm.org/installation
  clangd features https://clangd.llvm.org/features

  eglot keybindings
  (use-package eglot
    :bind (:map eglot-mode-map
         ("C-c l r" . eglot-rename)
         ("C-c l a" . eglot-code-actions)
         ("C-c l f" . eglot-format)))

  if you're not using use-package
  (define-key eglot-mode-map (kbd "C-c l r") 'eglot-rename)
  (define-key eglot-mode-map (kbd "C-c l a") 'eglot-code-actions)
  (define-key eglot-mode-map (kbd "C-c l f") 'eglot-format)</div>]]></description>
