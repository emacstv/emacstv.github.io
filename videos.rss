      <title>Demo of New Elisp Package: Master of Ceremonies</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IQtgfNEE5Q&amp;pp=ygUOZW1hY3MgZWxlbWVudHM%3D</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IQtgfNEE5Q&pp=ygUOZW1hY3MgZWxlbWVudHM%3D">youtube</a><br><br>Just added this one to MELPA.

  Master of Ceremonies is a new package for Emacs content creators.  It's the companion to Dslide.  I use it in basically every video I make.  Have some buffer text?  Great, now you have video content.  It's that simple.

  It's now really useful for quickly churning out images of buffer text in Emacs.  Its job is to display small excerpts of buffer text, but full frame with zero clutter.  From there, you can highlight, occlude, or remap all the faces to obtain something useful for making videos and other content.  Emacs can natively pump out SVGs, so you can use the outputs in a wide variety of roles.

  The package also has a lot of little gizmos for doing presentation.  It's all written up in the manual, so just install it and run M-x info-display-manaul RET dslide.

  I'll be going over the transient menus pretty soon to talk in-depth about how to use transient to go beyond just keymaps.  We will also discuss what MoC does behind the scenes and get a taste of Emacs display.

  This work is important.  If you can, tag my Github sponsors.  Everyone will be converted over to PrizeForge for our launch:

      <title>00: Why You Want Programmable Tools</title>

  We write the packages used to make a lot of this content!  Buy me a hamburger!  Dslide now supports keyboard macros.  Check it out!

  The first step is knowing why having a bunch of settings will never be as good as having programming in your workflow.  It will remain true because bootstrapping never goes away.  Ecosystem strength comes from user groups who share that philosophy.  You're in good company with Emacs.

      <title>Emacs: custom Org clock report for my coaching</title>
      <link>https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-12-15-emacs-org-coaching-clock/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMutOCOoFSQ">youtube</a><br><br>In this video, I demonstrate the custom code I have to generate Org clock reports for my coaching sessions. The idea is to use the `DEADLINE` and `CLOSED` timestamps of each task to calculate their elapsed time. This way, I do not need to manually clock in to the task and then clock out of it. It is easier to not have that overhead and not to duplicate the data that is already embedded in the aforementioned timestamps.

  The code for this is available on my website here: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-12-15-emacs-org-coaching-clock</div>]]></description>

Transcript

**Introduction**

Today, I'll demonstrate a useful Emacs mode: DAP mode. This mode allows you to integrate with the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) and debug your code directly within Emacs.

**DAP Mode vs. LSP DAP Mode**

There are two main DAP modes for Emacs: the newer DAP mode and the older LSP DAP mode. DAP mode is more closely aligned with Emacs Lisp primitives, making it more flexible and powerful. However, LSP DAP mode is simpler to set up and works well with LSP servers.

**Debugging a Go Project**

To illustrate, I'll use a Go project as an example. First, I'll set a breakpoint using a custom function that highlights the line for better visibility. This function is a workaround for a known issue with breakpoint markers being hidden.

**Starting the Debugger**

I'll start the debugging session using a configuration file that specifies the debugger (dlv in this case), the program to debug, and other relevant settings. Once the debugger starts, you'll see the current scope, variables, and logs in the Emacs window.

**Interacting with the Debugger**

You can interact with the debugger using various commands:

- **Stepping:** Step over, into, or out of functions.
- **Breakpoints:** Set, clear, and condition breakpoints.
- **Variables:** Inspect variable values.
- **Expressions:** Evaluate expressions.

**Integration with LSP**

DAP mode integrates seamlessly with LSP, providing features like:

- **Code completion:** Suggest variable and function names.
- **Go-to-definition:** Jump to the definition of a symbol.
- **Hover documentation:** Display documentation for symbols.

**Debugging Tests**

To debug tests, I use a custom function that automatically sets up the debugger for the current test function. This function leverages the `go-test` library to identify the test and start the debugger with the appropriate arguments.

**Conclusion**

DAP mode is a powerful tool for debugging your code within Emacs. By leveraging its integration with LSP and other Emacs features, you can significantly improve your debugging workflow.

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FTBMyLkPFw&t=0s .

01:09 Q: When I tried comparing transducers.el to cl-lib and dash (benchmark-compiled), I got the following results
05:40 Q: Do you know of any theoretical texts on transducers?
07:04 Q: Did you think about [compiler features, macros] viz your cl, fennel, elisp, porting of your transducers?
08:16 Q: Does t-buffer-read provide a lazy stream that's linewise, or charwise, or do something else entirely?
09:09 Q: Can the Elisp library be combined with the stream.el API or seq in general?
11:47 Q: How does one debug a t-comp expression? Can you single step and see intermediate results of the different statements you declare?
14:42 Q: Is there a path for transducers to enable elisp processing of otherwise overly large datasets as if just normal Emacs \"buffers\" (i.e. just pulling one thing at a time so essentially stream-like under the hood but buffer-like in interface), with none of the usual perf issues with a traditional buffer structure?
16:51 Q: Is there an option to read a csv/json and produce an alist or plist instead of a hash table for an entry?
17:50 Q: Is the common lisp version ready for 'production' use? Is it complete enough and the API stable enough?
18:17 Q: Do we need a pre-written \"t-\" version for every already existing reducing function like + or is there a function to construct them from already defined reducer 2-arg functions?
20:26 Q: Is the compelling argument for transducers is that it's a better abstraction?

00:38 Q: Do you have any thoughts about the process of recording something for a conference?
02:23 Q: I use org-roam for notes and find it very useful - have you considered it?
03:40 Q: Do you use the Getting Things Done methodology as part of your Org workflow?
05:58 Q: org-fc and org-drill are emacs org mode centric flash card solutions, have you looked into them?
07:27 Q: What do other students think about your approach - and what are they doing instead (if anything)? And your teachers - what do they think?
11:25 Q: What was your biggest source of frustration/friction/confusion when getting started with Emacs?
11:48 Q: How did you come across Emacs? What got you into it?
13:53 Q: What the situation with respect to "mobile" use (if ever that's applicable)? (yes, Orgzly...using that?)
15:21 Q: Has using emacs led to expanded interest in programming/computer science?
16:40 Q: How does interaction with others work in technical terms?

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eEtPnTknhQ&t=0s .

02:07 Q: What's the largest code base you've ever tackled with the literate approach (esp. Emacs + Org-mode)?
03:58 Q: Have you ever used org-transclusion?
04:08 Q: What is your usage of dynamic blocks in such workflows?
04:48 Q: Is the minibuffer being deliberately hidden in this video?
05:17 Q: What's your take on Emacs+Org vs. Jupyter notebooks (for interactive programming)?
07:07 Q: Do you think any programming language is more suited to literate programming than another?
08:21 Q: Do you use inline org function calls and org babel library and such?
09:36 Q: How do you handle the cases where org markup may sometimes interfere with some of the code?
11:06 Q: You said at the start that literate didn't catch on in corporate DevOps - why not?
11:29 Q: Why not that full stack on Markdown?
12:22 Corwin's aside on orgvm
14:49 Org and Markdown fragmentation
16:17 Q: How does your management of "TODOs" (projects/tasks) interact with this literate mindset, any insightful things you do on that front?
17:30 Q: Do you LP also on larger projects?
18:38 Q: Have you used Cucumber/Gherkin/BDD and do you think it has a strong overlap to what you talked about here?
19:54 Q: What granularity are you looking for re your org files and contents, with respect to a codebase that it tangles to, or in non-coding contexts?

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZJhMAMI7A0&t=0s .

00:16 Q: which-key was a third-party package for a long time. Is there work to bring any other popular packages into core Emacs for Emacs 31+? (magit, counsel, etc)
04:06 Q: Any way to get the goodness of Emacs for android with this other stuff?
05:15 Q: Does package-vc download a tarball from the specified git repository or clone the repository itself?
06:37 How is the new behavior of M-q in prog-mode (prog-fill-reindent-defun or something like that) different from the behavior of C-M-q (indent-pp-sexp) in older Emacs versions?
08:33 Q: Any plans for Emacs running in iOS?
09:08 Q: I am worried about the situation on non-free systems. There was talk about the Windows and the macOS versions being as good as unmaintained. Where do we go from here?
11:35 Q: Is there a best practice on what Org to use when following emacs-latest?

07:10 Q: Are there any patterns emerging, such that it would seem possible to 1) systematize 2) automate(?) the mapping of mode commands to keyboard-driven menus? Possibly even have an auto casual wrapper for an uncovered mode?

12:00 Q: Is there a setting to close menu after executing command?

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjC162DnsKI&t=0s .

03:01 Q: About fibers: My understanding is that the problem with making Elisp concurrent is that none of the data structures (buffer, cons, vector, window etc) are concurrency-safe.  How do fibers help with this?
04:28 Q: Do you have a rough idea of how much of Guile is written in C?
06:19 Q: A Common Lisp implementation for Guile sounds really cool! Is there already work on this underway?
08:34 Q: Did switching from guile 2 to 3 give any performance benefits?
10:46 Q: Do you know if the Emacs maintainers are interested in switching to Guile as the engine for Emacs Lisp?
12:30 Q: Do you think guile-emacs will be able to use or (collaborate with) some of the other awesome projects around Emacs Lisp?
15:04 Q: SBCL, ...You mentioned Robert Strandh's SICL along with SBCL---does that work help with the implementation of CL in Guile?

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTVXaDR697k&t=0s .

00:00 Q: Do you have any suggestions for interactive debugging of Julia code in Emacs?
01:15 Q: Can you call out something that Julia has that Emacs does not, and which could benefit Emacs?
02:38 Q: Is there a way to use lisp syntax with Julia, like hy for python or lisp flavoured erlang?
03:51 Q: Have you tried the Julia Snail package for Emacs? It tries to be like SLY/SLIME for Common Lisp.
04:26 Q: Is there a data inspector for a Julia REPL available that you can use in Emacs?
05:24 Q: Have you tried literate programming Julia (using Org babel or some other means) in Emacs?

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=629ct-cBwSI&t=0s .

00:08 Q: Have you considered using CRDTs to share buffers between threads and merge any concurrent edits automatically?
01:05 Q: Why hosted on GitHub? GitHub is nonfree. Is it possible to report bugs/send patches without using GitHub?
01:22 Q: Do you think it's possible to achieve 100% compatibility with current Emacs code?
02:11 Q: so you're re-implementing elisp in rust? have you considered using a more modern lisp, such as scheme? [11:03]
04:01 Q: Do you have specific features from the Rust compiler that are missing (or are nightly-only) that you would take advantage of?
05:26 Q: Can remacs be reused?
07:23 Q: What are you thoughts on the GUI layer. Any plans on how to reimplement it?
08:21 Q: If money could fix the problem, how much would it cost to ship this with feature parity before 2026?
09:28 GObject implementation
09:56 Q: elisp is implemented in c, so if you're not implementing elisp in rust, are you using/keeping the c implementation of elisp?
10:42 Clarifying rewriting Elisp in Rust
12:57 Q: Will your Rust implementation also be able to run Emacs bytecode? Or are you implementing it at the Lisp level?
14:20 Q: Is it possible to bootstrap with just the bytecode interpreter?
17:03 What would it take to bootstrap Guile in Rune?

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLEFuDolR6Y&t=0s .

03:09 Q: I'm curious to know how the hell guile-emacs deals with all of the dynamically scoped modules out there. Is there any effort to automatically modularize and namespace stuff?
05:23 Q: Would it be possible to support a GUI toolkit other than GTK?
06:45 Q: Do you plan to provide improvements to Elisp as a language, or is the focus on a compatibility layer to facilitate doing all new extensions, etc. in Scheme?
08:29 Q: Can we consider a translator like utility to convert elisp to scheme, once guile-emacs becomes a reality?
10:54 Q: Why is being able to interpret all of \`init.el\` an useful goal?
12:08 Q: What is the plan to handle elisp packages that depend on 3rd party/external libraries? (libgit/magit or rg/ripgrep)?
15:21 Q: Not really a question, but how about Schemacs as a name?
16:45 Q: Why is it not feasible for the Emacs layer that interprets Emacs Lisp (the core in C) ot have a Scheme interpreter, instead of using Guile?

This is the Q&A for the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKQcgpZS2GM&t=0s .

01:23 Q: I'd be interested how to start this journey of writing academic papers in Org-Roam when not having used Emacs Org-Mode yet? Thanks!
02:35 Q: How about connecting Emacs Org-Roam to Zotero? Is that something you have experience with?
02:55 Q: Out of curiosity, how do you manage your bibliography? Do you do it from inside Emacs, or using a separate program like Zotero?
06:22 Q: How do you start a new document?
07:41 Q: What do you think of using citar with org-roam-bibtex?
09:26 Q: Most academic journals insist that papers are formatted in their own custom LaTeX documentclass.  Does org-roam make it easy to do that?
14:21 Q: Are you using zotra or org-ref?
14:45 Q: How much of this is tied to org-roam specifically?

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iyCkEA_KaY">youtube</a><br><br>In this stream, we'll try to hack the built-in Emacs Modus Themes to produce a custom theme that fits the System Crafters aesthetic.  We'll do this by tweaking a number of customization settings in the Modus Themes including the ability to apply color palette overrides.

  Is it easier to make your own custom theme or tweak the Modus Themes?  Let's find out!

  GET GOOD AT GIT:

  Have you used Git for a while but still feel like you donât really understand what youâre doing? Do you wish you understood how Git really works under the hood? Wish you knew all the cool techniques that the expert hackers use?

  In December, I'll be running a new one-day workshop called "Git Good: From Basics to Beyond in 4 Hours" that will teach you many of the secrets of expert Git users within 4 hours while giving you hands-on exercises to try it all for yourself!

      <title>Demo of org-mode&apos;s cycling of folds with TAB and SHIFT+TAB</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEdOj0zcDWk</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEdOj0zcDWk">youtube</a><br><br>https://orgmode.org/ has a simple and effective way to fold/collapse the entirety or parts of a hierarchical document, recursively.
  - TAB cycles through the folding state of the element where the cursor is and its children.
  - SHIFT+TAB cycles through the folding state of the entire document regardless of the cursor's position.

  In this screencap, I show several operations, each with a different starting cursor position and/or starting folding state, where I hit the TAB or SHIFT+TAB keys, showing how elements get folded or unfolded recursively. I do it twice for each operation.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Yay Emacs 7: using word timing in caption editing with subed-word-data</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/shorts/JeBg7-cF4Zk</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/JeBg7-cF4Zk">youtube</a><br><br>https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/11/yay-emacs-7-using-word-timing-in-caption-editing-with-subed-word-data/

  When I work with video captions, I often want to split long captions using subed-split-subtitle. If my player is somewhere in the current subtitle, it'll use that timestamp. If not, it'll make a reasonable guess based on character position.

  I can use subed-word-data.el to load word-level times from WhisperX JSON or from Youtube SRV2 files. This allows me to split a subtitle using the timestamp for that word.

  Because subed-word-data colours words based on transcription confidence, I can see where something might need to be closely examined, like when there's no timing information for the words at the start or end.

  If I combine that with subed-waveform, I can see silences. Then I can tweak start times by shift-left-clicking on the waveform. This automatically adjusts the end time of the previous subtitle too.

  I like how Emacs makes it easy to use word timing data when editing captions. Yay Emacs!</div>]]></description>

      <title>Exploring Emacs Completion Styles - System Crafters Live!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNdOBXVdd1Q</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNdOBXVdd1Q">youtube</a><br><br>In this stream, we'll dive deeper into Emacs' built-in "completion styles", the code that determines how what you type in the minibuffer is matched against the set of all completion candidates.

  We'll experiment with the built in completion styles, try tweaking 'completion-styles-alist' to customize completion for different minibuffer commands, and also take a look at the code for some of these (including the package 'orderless') to understand how they work!

      <title>shadow-css for personal use - Emacs, Browser, Clojure, REPL Screencast</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TwLHQrqG4w</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TwLHQrqG4w">youtube</a><br><br>Visit the page here: https://faster-than-light-memes.xyz/documentaries.html

  Tiny overview of my personal usage of [[https://github.com/thheller/shadow-css][shadow-css]], which I like.



  Conceptually tiny:

  - Write something like =(css :p-4 :mt-2)=, =css= is a macro that just returns a classname, nothing else
  - shadow-css analyses your =clj/cljs/cljc= sources outputs .css files where the class names =your_namespace_L44=, that's it.

  This is the /clj hiccup shadow-css scittle/ stack.

  It *builds* using *babashka* only, generating *html* from *hiccup* source code,
  for *development*, you run a clj repl, optionally with a *scittle nrepl* in the *browser*, too.

  *CSS* is generated with the /tailwind-like/ *shadow-css*.

  This stack grew bottom up.

  Resources:

  - [[https://github.com/thheller/shadow-css][shadow-css]]
  - [[https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2024/10/30/supercharging-the-repl-workflow.html][Thomas Heller REPL blog post]]
  - screencast (soon)
  - [[https://github.com/benjamin-asdf/faster-than-light-memes?tab=readme-ov-file#gen-html-with-clojure-gen-css-with-shadow-css][code]]

  All build steps run with babashka, which is fast!

  -------------

  (Currently, the build duration of my blog is dominated by the emacs org html gen).

  -------------

  This would go well together with a clojure server that returns html,
  optionally with [[https://github.com/thheller/shadow-graft][shadow-graft]].

  Clojurescript and/or reagent could be added if needed.
  (Or, because scittle can do reagent).

  -------------

  It's something I would consider for small-medium projects.

  -------------

  The screencast is meant to showcase the intersection of emacs, meow, lispy, clojure, browser and repl driven development.

      <title>33 CL, Add C-c C-j Functionality from Slime to Sly in Emacs</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4dgRlGy6dk</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4dgRlGy6dk">youtube</a><br><br>Similar to slime-eval-last-expression-in-repl C-c C-j

  My first time messing with elisp and creating a shortcut in emacs.

  Copy command from lisp file to sly mrepl and eval it, making sure at end of mrepl buffer first.
  Does not add all functionality like changing the packages back and forth.

  ;;; The mark is not set now, so there is no region
  ;;; was error I as getting from interactive "r"

  ;;; Similar slime-eval-last-expression-in-repl C-c C-j
  (defun copy-to-repl-and-eval (&optional begin end)
    "Copies previous sexp to bottom of buffer in repl and evals"
    (interactive (if (use-region-p) (list (region-beginning) (region-end))))
    (backward-sexp)
    (mark-sexp)
    (kill-ring-save (region-beginning) (region-end) t)
    (forward-sexp)
    (let ((slyrepl (sly-mrepl)))
      (if (get-buffer-window slyrepl 'visible)
   (switch-to-buffer-other-window slyrepl)
        (switch-to-buffer slyrepl)))
    (goto-char (point-max))
    (yank)
    (sly-mrepl-return))

  (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook
     '(lambda ()
        (local-set-key (kbd "C-c C-j") #'copy-to-repl-and-eval)))

  ;;; I switched from C-[return] to C-c C-j, since YT does not allow angle brackets in description of video.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Yay #Emacs 5: Tweaking my video workflow with WhisperX and subed-record</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/shorts/s6Y_wx-4xsI</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/s6Y_wx-4xsI">youtube</a><br><br>I'm tweaking my video workflow. I use Orgzly Revived on my Android phone to write the text, and I use Easy Voice Recorder to record it. Syncthing automatically copies both to my laptop. I use WhisperX to transcribe my recording, and I use a little bit of Emacs Lisp to figure out timestamps for each word. I edit this to fix errors. I can even rearrange things and get rid of anything I don't want.Then I use subed-convert to turn it into a VTT file. I can tweak the start and end times by looking at the waveforms. Then I add comments with the visuals I want. I can add images, animated GIFs, or videos, and they're automatically squeezed or stretched to fit. I can also have them play at original speed. Then I set up open captions and use subed-record-compile-video. Tada!

      <title>Yay #Emacs: Embark completion with C-h</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/shorts/NUgKVOX6UZQ</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/NUgKVOX6UZQ">youtube</a><br><br>I use Embark to configure context-sensitive keyboard shortcuts that I can bring up with embark-act, which I've bound to "C-c .". If I pause for a moment, it'll show me which-key lists of the shortcuts. To switch to the next set of shortcuts, I can press the same shortcut again. Sometimes this list is still hard to skim. I can use C-h to select a command with completion, which is extra nice with vertico-multiform-mode and a little configuration.

I want to be able to quickly copy or replace my custom links with regular web links, like the ones I use when I export to HTML.

  My shortcut for this is `C-. u` to copy the exported URL and `C-. r` to rewrite a link. These stand for `my-embark-org-copy-exported-url` and `my-embark-replace-link-with-exported-url` respectively.

      <title>Yay Emacs 6: Inserting links with consult-omni</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/shorts/GH4zBesvupk</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/GH4zBesvupk">youtube</a><br><br>I want to quickly look up and add links. consult-omni (https://github.com/armindarvish/consult-omni) lets me search within Emacs instead of switching to a web interface. After I set up consult-omni-google with a Google custom search engine and a JSON API key, I can call it with my shortcut: `M-g w'. Using `M-n' for future history pulls in the word at point. Then I can select a site and use Embark to insert with `C-. i' or copy with `C-. w'.

      <title>Emacs: commands in popup frames with emacsclient</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbWxT8tht9A</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbWxT8tht9A">youtube</a><br><br>In this 15-minute video I show the custom code I have to run any Emacs command in a popup frame. The advantage of this is that I do not need to be in Emacs already. The examples I show cover 'org-capture' and my 'tmr' package.

  The code is available on my website (where you can also find all my other publications): https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-09-19-emacs-command-popup-frame-emacsclient/</div>]]></description>

  I talk about buff stackability in emacs:
  here're the notes for the video from the ideation buffer:
  https://buffer.thebitmage.com/sitemap?stack=%2F20230712224009-emacs.html#org09cb969

  A lot of pragmatic emacs stuff coming your way,
  do like share & subscribe if you find it interesting..

  Corrections:
   - I mention that magit used hydra somewhere in there...
   - it uses transient, which is similar but not hydra...

  Thanks for tuning in,
  see you in the next one,

We chat about Prot's journey into Linux, Emacs, and Free Software.

He tells us about his secluded lifestyle and future plans, emphasizing self-sufficiency and continual exploration of philosophy and Emacs. Don't miss this deep dive into the life and perspectives of Prot, where philosophy meets practicality and of course Emacs and its community.

It is the ability to exclude directories and their files from the output of Org dynamic blocks on a per-block basis.

      <title>Emacs: use-package essentials</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaqtzemHFDU</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaqtzemHFDU">youtube</a><br><br>In this ~35-minute video I demonstrate the main features of the 'use-package' configuration macro that is built into Emacs 29. It is the de facto standard for setting up packages and is designed to make Emacs faster to start up and more robust overall.

  The contents of what I showed in this video are posted on my website: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-07-23-emacs-use-package-essentials

  This tutorial focuses on Emacs's org-mode's table functionality. Tables on a surface level are simple. However, with the power of org-mode they become a spreadsheet system, time-tracking tool, programming tool, and much more.

  Small correction the reason I used :export both was for use with org export. I should have removed that from the version used in this video.

  One package I recommend checking out is https://github.com/casouri/valign if you work with lots of images and latex fragments. It does a better job at aligning the table in these cases than default emacs does.

      <title>Emacs: modern minibuffer packages (Vertico, Consult, etc.)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3aaxOqwHhI</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3aaxOqwHhI">youtube</a><br><br>In this ~44 minute video I demonstrate packages that upgrade the experience with Emacs. They are about the minibuffer: where we interact with Emacs to call a command by its name or pick a candidate for some action.

  The packages I cover are `vertico`, `marginalia`, `consult`, `orderless`, and `embark`. I also mention briefly the `wgrep` package as well as the built-in `savehist-mode`, `recentf-mode`.

  A related video I did about search (search+replace): https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-06-10-emacs-search-replace-basics/.

  The sample configuration I mentioned in this video is available here: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-02-17-emacs-modern-minibuffer-packages/.

  Conda lends support for anaconda / miniconda - a virtualenv replacement and then some.

  Envrc takes care of direnv support - a way to automatically set up your environment when you change into a directory.

      <title>Emacs: control where buffers are displayed (the &apos;display-buffer-alist&apos;)</title>

      <title>Emacs: abbreviations with abbrev-mode (quick text expansion)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruPpRlh2re4</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruPpRlh2re4">youtube</a><br><br>In this ~27 minute video, I explain how to use the built-in `abbrev-mode` to define "abbreviations" for quick-yet-powerful text expansion. I cover the most simple scenario and then go into more technical implementations: (i) to use a function instead of a predetermined text, and (ii) to expand what counts as an abbreviation so as to use characters that are not word constituents.

  The code I had in my scratch buffer is on my website: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-02-03-emacs-abbrev-mode</div>]]></description>

      <title>Emacs: define  prefix/leader key (nested key maps)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gojOZ3k1mmk</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gojOZ3k1mmk">youtube</a><br><br>In this ~24 minute video I show how to define a prefix key in Emacs using built-in functionality. The idea is to organise our keys in an efficient way. Using this method, we can have nested key maps as well, meaning that the prefix key can have access to the contents of another map which holds more key bindings. Put simply, we can have "C-z" as a prefix, "C-z b" as a nested key maps for buffer-related commands, and "C-z f" for file-related commands. This is a neat way to provide quick access to our most used commands.

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycyxytk1NAQ</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycyxytk1NAQ">youtube</a><br><br>In this ~25 minute video, I present my new Emacs configuration. It is an advanced setup that starts with a literate Org program as the "source of truth". This file generates all the individual modules and custom libraries of my setup. I explain all the technicalities and why this approach is the best of both worlds to (i) document the rich corpus of work found in my dotfiles while (ii) not compromising on code excellence.

In the last few weeks, I've made a few additions to my config, including adding the ability to read and annotate PDFs from inside Emacs.  Also, I've been playing around with 'ediff' which is a builtin 'diff' program...

      <title>Emacs: multilingual editing (Greek, French, Chinese, etc.)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFzdPjeSN8E</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFzdPjeSN8E">youtube</a><br><br>In this ~10 minute video I show how to use Emacs to edit text in multiple languages. This is better than using the system-level keyboard layout configuration because you retain all the functionality of Emacs for key bindings (e.g. 'C-n', 'C-p', 'M-x'). In the video I demonstrate the various input methods, with prefix or postfix notation, and character composition.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMq-703ZVZQ">youtube</a><br><br>In this ~13 minute video I demonstrate the new functionality I am developing for Denote. It allows us to produce sorted lists of files based on any of the file name components that Denote formalises. The command 'denote-sort-dired' leverages this facility, as do the Org dynamic blocks that Denote defines.

      <title>Emacs: Denote Org dynamic blocks</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzXcav0yb50</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzXcav0yb50">youtube</a><br><br>In this video I demonstrate Denote's Org dynamic blocks facility. I focus on the new 'denote-files' Org dynamic block that I am developing. In short, this new block lets you include the contents of files with the option to also add links to them as well as to omit their front matter from the block. It is a neat way to quickly consolidate your writings on a given topic.

      <title>Emacs Micro Lesson #9 | Start Process</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TggT9_RxPqY&amp;list=PLKpFPBl1UnIpUPd0kfMCObsi4rb9LQlD-&amp;index=9&amp;pp=iAQB</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TggT9_RxPqY&list=PLKpFPBl1UnIpUPd0kfMCObsi4rb9LQlD-&index=9&pp=iAQB">youtube</a><br><br>That’s right. Let’s take a common scenario. You’re doing some work in Emacs. Maybe you’re programming. Maybe you’re writing a novel. It doesn’t matter what you’re doing. You want to start playing some music or run a backup of your files in the background. You can open up a different app or your terminal emulator and run a command.

  What if you could run that background process from Emacs with a simple function? One and done. That’s how we like to do things in the Emacs world. The best way to get this done is to use a function called (you guessed it already), start-process.

      <title>Live: Emacs package maintenance (mostly about &apos;denote&apos;)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k0pZXQrQSs&amp;list=PL8Bwba5vnQK14z96Gil86pLMDO2GnOhQ6&amp;index=18&amp;pp=iAQB</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k0pZXQrQSs&list=PL8Bwba5vnQK14z96Gil86pLMDO2GnOhQ6&index=18&pp=iAQB">youtube</a><br><br>This stream will be recorded for future reference.  I will do some work on my Denote package and maybe tackle other Emacs-related issues.  I plan to make this about 2 hours long, though we will see in practice.

  This video is also available on my website: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-09-25-emacs-live-mostly-denote/

  ## About Denote

  Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to link between them.

  Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to "notes".  It can be used for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs, such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.

  - Package name (GNU ELPA): `denote`

      <title>An Emacs &quot;Killer Feature&quot; Is Bulk Renaming</title>

And there really aren't many simple solutions for this.  Typically, a bulk rename involves piping together a few shell commands.  But one program makes bulk renaming a breeze...EMACS!

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRpHIa-2XCE</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRpHIa-2XCE">youtube</a><br><br>A 30 minute video about opening up a text box and typing something into it for later, made for people who watch videos about doing that rather than just getting work done.

00:29 Requirements
4:10 Zettlr, VNote, and nb
5:48 Zim
7:50 QOwnNotes
12:31 The end of pretending this is about productivity
14:48 Emacs
21:18 Neovim
25:59 It never ends
27:12 Kakoune, Helix, Vis, Neatvi (I don't use these)

Please look at silverbullet.md, a browser based, MIT licensed markdown notes editor that seems very in line with my personal tastes. It would be up there in the A tier.

I’ve messed with Kakoune a bit and think I’ll make a follow up about taking notes in kak (and Helix) since there were some challenges and considerations. Emacs is the best all around for notes but can be slow, Neovim is the fastest and best supported, Kakoune has interesting consistent bindings and minimalist philosophy, and Helix is snappy and kak-ish but wordier and not extensible. I could just pick one and stick with it but why not overanalyze all of them more??</div>]]></description>

In this video, I spend most of my time cleaning up the config file by moving a lot code to other locations.  I also add a lot of important keybindings and add some new theming options.

  John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

  James 1:5 - "If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you."

  I thank God for all the wisdom he has blessed me with.

      <title>Emacs Eglot</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czcnl-d34Mg&amp;pp=ygUOZW1hY3MgZWxlbWVudHM%3D</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czcnl-d34Mg&pp=ygUOZW1hY3MgZWxlbWVudHM%3D">youtube</a><br><br>In this video, I discuss Emacs' Eglot package, a language server protocol package for Emacs. With Eglot you can easily set up LSP for your language of choice. I demonstrate this with the Dart programming language showing you how to install and set up Eglot, then how to use Eglot to jump to definition, to find all references of a function, and how to rename all occurrences of a function throughout the document. I show you all "completion at point", which gives you all possible completions for an object in your programming language of choice.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_34OVueqYNU">youtube</a><br><br>Yes, you too can keep your working files in a nice orderly condition using an archive file.  Don't rely on default, basic, archiving to the same directory.  That won't work this time.  You can use org mode to set up a custom archive file location for storing your important work in long term retrieval refrigeration.  This works nicely with org roam if you have one master node for keeping a running list of active files in play, the archive the stuff you're done with.  It's simple, with default Emacs options, find out how.  Watch.

      <title>Live: Emacs DENOTE unit testing</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44_eLHxSMmo&amp;list=PL8Bwba5vnQK14z96Gil86pLMDO2GnOhQ6&amp;index=25&amp;pp=iAQB</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44_eLHxSMmo&list=PL8Bwba5vnQK14z96Gil86pLMDO2GnOhQ6&index=25&pp=iAQB">youtube</a><br><br>No work at home, no work for hut project, so I am doing a live stream about my `denote` package.  I want to get into unit testing with the `ert` package that is built into Emacs.  **The video will be recorded and can be watched later.**

  I have never written unit tests before.  I want to learn them as a general skill, but also because I want `denote` to have comprehensive tests in place before its next major release.

  I understand I am announcing this without much prior notice (current time 13:02 +0300).  No worries!

  ## About Denote

  Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to link between them.

  Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to "notes".  It can be used for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs, such as videos.  Naming files in a constistent way makes their filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.

  In today's stream, we'll explore the depths of Emacs' Dired feature to see if we can discover some of its lesser-known capabilities.  We'll try to figure out bulk file operations, file previews, advanced Dired buffer tricks, and more.  If you use Dired for basic file management capabilities, this is our chance to figure out more valuable ways to use it!

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1P8DIxG4gBE</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1P8DIxG4gBE">youtube</a><br><br>Du hack, du fun et de l'invest.

  Contenu : On va voir dans cette vidéo comment installer Doom Emacs.

  Au préalable, avant toute installation, prenez soin de faire vos sauvegardes ! Pour installer Archlinux :

  1/ Methode Endeavour os
  https://endeavouros.com/
  C'est la méthode la plus simple, celle que je recommande.

  2/ Methode Archinstall :
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall

  3/ Methode Manjaro
  (Mais attention ce n'est pas vraiment archlinux)
  https://manjaro.org/

  Et pour l'installation de Doom Emacs :

      <title>Live: General Emacs maintenance work</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8NaZV1LdN8</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8NaZV1LdN8">youtube</a><br><br>It is raining and I have no coaching work right now...  I am thus planning to do a live stream on various Emacs topics.  The video will be recorded and can be watched later.

  There is nothing specific I want to talk about.  I will just do some general maintenance of Emacs code and go with the flow.

  A non-exhaustive list of items:

  - Write a `defalias` of `modus-themes-items` to `modus-themes-collection`.

  - Write the inverse for the `ef-themes`.

  - Document in the Modus manual how to add more spacing in the frame and between windows.

  - Solve a problem on how to get the cursor colour from the current theme (see snippet below).

    ```elisp
    ;; Getting the cursor color
    (car (alist-get 'cursor ef-duo-dark-palette))
    ;; "#ef6f11"

    ;; Getting the theme and adding the "-palette" string to match the alist
    (intern-soft (format "%s-palette"
                         (car custom-enabled-themes)))
    ;; ef-duo-dark-palette

    ;; Getting frustrated for not being able to see the error....
    (alist-get 'cursor
               (intern-soft (format "%s-palette"
                                    (car custom-enabled-themes))))
    ```

  - Contribute to the Denote mailing list thread about linking to non-note files: https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fs8b85tq.fsf%40prevos.net%3E.

  Of course, I can also do whatever else may come up during the chat.  I understand this is a short notice (I am typing this at 2023-05-06 08:01 +0300), so no worries if you can't make it.

  Reply only in pure lisp expressions that can then be evaluated with "eval-expression". Do not include any comments or explanations. If the answer consists of multiple expressions, wrap them inside a "progn" form.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Jump around huge code bases in Emacs without LSP or TAGS</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHWL13sQBWY</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHWL13sQBWY">youtube</a><br><br>dumb-jump lets you navigate large code bases fast and without LSP or a TAGS file. The "dumb" jumper takes the right turn most of the time. I'll show it off on #java, #c and #bash code.

  Update: The reason it couldn't find the first Java class I tried it on, ConfiguredValidator, was that this *wasn't* a class in the repo. As you can see in my second use case, the DropwizardResourceConfig class, it can successfully jump to classes in the same repository.

      <title>Let&apos;s read the Emacs source code</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P-gOh_gyiM</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P-gOh_gyiM">youtube</a><br><br>In this live stream, I look at the source code for the popular text editor Emacs.

  Emacs development dates back to the 1970s and the MIT AI lab's attempt to create a hardware Lisp machine -- that is, a machine modeled more or less on the Lambda calculus. In the video, I unintentionally stumble upon a priority dispute over who actually wrote and designed the original Emacs, and I ask ChatGPT to render its judgment.

  Then, about 23 minutes in, I start digging into the code for GNU Emacs. Gnu Emacs dates back to the mid 1980s and is easily the most popular surviving Emacs implementation.

  Correction: I said I thought Steele was one of the authors of the "famous Lisp book," but that's incorrect. I was thinking of the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs," often called SICP. Steele's frequent coauthor Gerald Sussman is indeed an author of SICP, but Steele didn't work on that book. The other co-authors of SICP are Harold Abelson and Julie Sussman.

  Code reading starts at 22:55 after some diving into the history of Emacs.

      <title>Fast, Async LaTeX Previews in Org Mode</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-AfvuV-bYo</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-AfvuV-bYo">youtube</a><br><br>Instructions for installation at https://abode.karthinks.com/org-latex-preview (Warning: development branch, bugs ahead!)

  00:00 LaTeX previews in Org Mode
  00:39 LaTeX Previews are generated in bulk, and hundreds of LaTeX fragments can be processed per second.
  01:23 Images are placed in the buffer continuously as they are generated.
  02:00 Preview generation is asynchronous and will not block Emacs.
  03:02 Previews are coloured to match surrounding text and the active theme.
  03:26 Previews automatically change colors when the active theme changes.
  04:04 Inline previews are aligned and scaled to match the font baseline and size.
  04:13 Previews scale along with text when the text scale is changed.
  04:38 Preview overlays can hide and show themselves dynamically based on cursor position.
  05:18 Org mode can auto-generate LaTeX previews as you type or edit the text of existing ones.
  06:53 Error encountered when compiling LaTeX fragments can be accessed by mousing over preview images.
  07:53 Previews are auto-generated irrespective of how they're added to the buffer.
  08:19 Org mode can keep equation numbering consistent by regenerating previews as needed.

  11:20 SVG vs PNG previews

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhyr8kvKa2I&t=1s">youtube</a><br><br>Today we will be taking a look at an Emacs feature known as the mark ring. We'll be discussing the differences between global and local marks. We'll also be covering how and when marks are added to these mark rings. In addition, we'll share some configuration recommendations to steam line the experience of using this feature.

  PLEASE NOTE:  At around : 3:10, I mention that there are two condition that's required in order to add a new mark to the global mark ring. This is actually not true, only the first condition is required. Please see the updated show notes below.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwU9e4NlJU4">youtube</a><br><br>Make your repetitive SEO tasks for web writing a little easier with Emacs, org mode, and a little Emacs lisp.  You can do it.  Org mode exports some random anchor link ids into your document.  You can customize these yourself with a custom properity, "custom id", but why not have org mode do it automatically.  Let's find out together.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj0w8cYkKFI">youtube</a><br><br>Substitute is a set of commands that perform text replacement (i) throughout the buffer, (ii) limited to the current definition (per `narrow-to-defun`), (iii) from point to the end of the buffer, and (iv) from point to the beginning of the buffer.

  These substitutions are meant to be as quick as possible and, as such, differ from the standard `query-replace` (which I still use).  The provided commands prompt for substitute text and perform the substitution outright.

      <title>Create Your Own Emacs Start Page</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADVCHpdmA5M</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADVCHpdmA5M">youtube</a><br><br>In the last few days, I have been playing around with creating my own "start page" for Doom Emacs.  By default, Doom comes with its own "dashboard" program but I wanted to create my own, mainly for the experience, but also because I could create a start page that was tailored exactly to my needs..

      <title>Emacs | Take Notes On Top of Notes</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZi5T6jhvLM</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZi5T6jhvLM">youtube</a><br><br>Now you can take notes on top of other notes within your general collection of notes in Emacs in Org Mode.  We're talking pure mastery here in your "personal knowledge management" system.  (I didn't know there was such a term, but it seems to fit org mode quite well.)  But Emacs is more than that, it's also a text editor.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW7LxxrTs5Y">youtube</a><br><br>My Emacs configuration file has grown large after more than 20 years of searching for my editor nirvana. More than 1,600 lines of Lisp goodness. This Christmas, I decided to start off from scratch, only adding the lines I truly needed.

  After 3-4 days, I had around 500 lines that provided me with everything I needed: Org, XML, YAML, Java, BASH, compile buffer, Magit, nice theme and everything else.

  In this video, I go through these to me precious 500 lines of packages, tweaks, hacks and custom functions I still cannot live without.

      <title>Emacs rip-grep automatically switch to results buffer</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbfxXQzc3hY</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbfxXQzc3hY">youtube</a><br><br>rip-grep on Emacs doesnt automatically switch to the results buffer,
  so you have to press C-x o to switch to the results buffer manually every time you use rip-grep

  Luckily i found an issue on the rg github issue page with some code by Howard Melman that fixes the issue and automatically switches to the rip-grep results buffer

  emacs init.el

      <title>74. На примере комментариев взаимодействие JQuery Ajax + Django 4 в IDE  Emacs.</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-vvw0Tgxz8</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-vvw0Tgxz8">youtube</a><br><br>74. Практика использования Jquery Ajax + Django 4 в  Emacs. Полная картина взаимодействия.
  Занятие длинное 59 минут.
   Не пугайтесь, я запишу для участников короткие уроки, где Мы все продублируем, но уже быстро и коротко.

   Перед этим длинным занятием ставилась задача.
   Показать взаимодействие Ajax и Django, показать глде и что мы пишем, как связаны части Джанго, а именно представление, html файлы c Ajax JQuery.

   Так же по ходу хотел дать направление для изучение, JQuery Ajax:
            -показал как работать с документацией;
            - что бы было понятно, что Джанго это одни знания;
            - Питон это то что нам даёт понимать Джанго;
            - Что Джанго использует библитеку http и она прописана в HttpRequest классе.
            - Хотел показать, что Ajax о Джанго ничего не знает и мы прописываем селекторы.
            - Заострил внимание. а как подступиться к JQuery Ajax, показал простоту.
           -  научитесь писать  middleware (промежуточный слой), мы с вами написали функцию, которую убрали с Джанго 4 is_ajax() и сделали из неё middleware, теперь будет работать для всего проекта эта функция.

            Что бы увидели, что современный разработчик оперирует знаниями разными и здесь не нужно отчаиваться, просто берём и делаем, а потом пер осмысливаем. Если поработать с месяц с Ajax, то все получится.
            Главное, что у вас после просмотра видео будет понимание, как это используется в комплексе. А это уже даёт хорошую платформу для старта.
            Так же хотел, что бы Вы узнали о Emacs и попробовали его, обязательно получится сделать среду своей мечты, ведь это прекрасно, когда вам то одного не хватает, и вы доделываете, потом следующее и следующее и у вас появится среда, которая вас будет радовать и вы полностью откажетесь от мыши, к этому стремится любой программист.

      <title>Emacs | Org Mode Basics For Beginners</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDcDn5wQz5E</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDcDn5wQz5E">youtube</a><br><br>The basics of org mode comes down to a few things:

  Headings
  Tags
  Lists

  If you can get down these basic concepts you’re ready to move onto bigger obstacles like agenda views, capture templates, attachments, exports, babel, and much more. But start with the basics!

  Headings
  Everything in org mode starts with headings in files. You open a file (with a .org extension, and you start adding headings.

  Headings are identified by asterisks (*, or “stars”) and they are hierarchical, which means they can be nested in multiple levels.

  * Heading level 1
  ** Heading level 2
  *** Heading level 3 (and so forth)

  Headings can be rearranged in any order by holding down the Meta (or, Alt) key and using the arrows on your keyboard.

  Tags

  Tags are used to additional context to heading items.

  To add a tag, you can hover over a heading and click C-c C-c. You will be prompted to add a tag. Tab auto completion works here as well, if you want to assign an existing tag.

  Lists
  Org mode offers some powerful list-making tools. You can use dashes to start lists:

  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  - Item 3
  Then you can check boxes to these lists:

  - [ ] Take out garbage
  - [ ] Prepare tax declaration
  - [ ] Start a business
  You can check and uncheck these items with C-c C-c. (This keystroke does a lot of magical things in org mode.)

  You can also use progress indicators to see how much of the list is complete:

  - My list [/] [%]
   - [ ] Take out garbage
   - [ ] Prepare tax declaration
   - [ ] Start a business
  Watch the progress indicators move as you complete your list.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Emacs: modus-themes version 4 (major feature)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPNMHrF4Lq8</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPNMHrF4Lq8">youtube</a><br><br>I demonstrate how the new theme palettes work with the "semantic colour mappings" and how to override every single entry therein. This is a flexible and powerful mechanism that gives users near complete control over the looks of the theme. As such, I am deprecating user options that produced colour variations: they were not flexible and added to the complexity of the code base.

  The new version is in development (check the `version-4` branch). I plan to merge it into `main` in the coming days and formalise the release by the end of December 2022 or the beginning of January 2023.

      <title>Emacs packages ednc, vertico, consult, embark, marginalia, orderless and fd-dired</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gal3YxBkusY</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gal3YxBkusY">youtube</a><br><br>Taking a look at the following emacs packages, Emacs Desktop Notification Center, vertico, marginalia, consult, embark, orderless and fd-dired

  vertico, marginalia, consult, embark, orderless can be used to replace ivy or helm as a completion framework

  consult has a nice switch to buffer function that will preview buffers before you switch to them

  orderless will let you match against any part of a sting in the mini buffer
  so instead of typing package-update-all, you can just search for update and it will match package-update-all

  fd-dired will let you search using fd which is faster than find and return the results in a dired buffer you can interact with as opposed to return fd in the terminal which will just show you a list of the files

  To install fd on ubuntu install the fd-find package

  sudo apt install fd-find

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVjuVH-moAc</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVjuVH-moAc">youtube</a><br><br>Getting more out of the org mode file attachment system, yes you can do it.

  I made a video about org mode attachments a while, you can see it here:

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPUdbLFJmqs

  And a video about my rolling log system:

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzq6WTWt0FU

  I wanted to revisit this idea and expand upon it a little.

  You can attach all kinds of files to a node in org mode, but sometimes you will want to attach files that Emacs cannot open properly.

  What you can do is open your attachment directory in the shell, open your file manager, and this will zap you right into the attachment directory, to save some time and energy.

  Q&A: https://pad.emacsconf.org/2022-lspbridge

  LSP Bridge's goal is to become the fastest LSP client in Emacs.

  LSP Bridge uses python's threading technology to build caches that bridge Emacs and LSP servers. Lsp-bridge will provide a smooth completion experience without compromising to slow down emacs' performance.</div>]]></description>

      <title>How to use Emacs when you&apos;re new on the job</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWRZTaKFOsQ</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWRZTaKFOsQ">youtube</a><br><br>You've landed your first job in IT and would like to use Emacs, but are worried about the time it takes to set it up? Are you worried that your colleagues will expect more from you and that it would be safer to use VS Code or whatever the others are using? Here's how I solved that when I started out as a developer in 2003:

  1) Setup the development stack that "everyone" around you are using (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse)
  2) In your spare time, set up Emacs to do the same
  3) Configure both editors to auto reload files so you can quickly Alt+Tab between them
  4) As you grow into the job, so will your Emacs setup
  5) As months go by, you'll use Emacs more and more and the "everyone editor" less and less.

  With this approach, you can take your time to ease into the job, learn all the other things you must in order to deliver. At the same time, when time allows, you can re-create the setup using your preferred tools, like Emacs.

  To have Emacs automatically reload files changed in VS Code, IntelliJ++, I use:
  ```
  (global-auto-revert-mode 1)
  ```

      <title>Why Are Lisp Macros So Great!?</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=M4qj2ictRpg&amp;feature=share</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=M4qj2ictRpg&feature=share">youtube</a><br><br>This tutorial is focused on Common Lisp and Emacs Lisp macros. Lisp macros are one of the things that has kept lisp relevant to this day. Since no matter how languages try to mimic them they just never fit as well as they do in Lisps. I hope to do a future video on hygienic macros like you see in Scheme and Clojure. In addition, cover macros on a deeper level in the future.

  - More Example Macros

  - Common Lisp Pattern Matching

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYGwG62VMGw">youtube</a><br><br>Emacs 29 new functions, commands and depreciated options,
  define-key and global-set-key have been replaced with a new simpler method of specifying keybindings.

  package-update-all will updated all of your packages instead of using package-list-packages,  scratch-buffer will create a new scratch buffer in case you deleted the scratch buffer

  emacsclient has a new -r option, with this command-line option, Emacs reuses an existing graphical client frame if one exists; otherwise it creates a new frame.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDwHHFbJ49s">youtube</a><br><br>In this video I share some more advanced examples of interacting with the mark and region. They're summarized here.

  Kill-ring - a ring-buffer of previously wiped text, access with C-y, then repeated M-y.
  M-@ - select next word, and repeat this command to expand the region
  M-h - select whole paragraph (e.g. function in code)
  C-x h (or C-x C-p) - select whole buffer (e.g. copy whole file)
  transient-mark-mode - enabled by default, this minor mode highlights the active region after you set the mark
  C-u C-SPC - Cycle through the ring of previously set marks (e.g. bookmark points in the file).

  00:00 Intro
  00:24 Kill-ring and multiple yanks
  01:43 Expanding the region by word
  02:19 Selecting functions and whole files
  02:56 Transient Mark Mode
  03:56 The mark ring
  04:53 C-x C-x
  05:29 Thank you!

As a result of using compiled code (instead of elisp), emacs-libvterm is fully capable, fast, and it can seamlessly handle large outputs.

  In this video i show you how to install vterm and multi-vterm in emacs and the settings you need to add to your emacs init.el file and shell config

  I also cover vterm copy mode and adding keyboard shorts for multi-vterm,
  as well as the new windmove command on emacs 29

  Update:
  I did have an issue where vterm was installed but prompted me to reinstall the vterm library

      <title>!!Con 2021 - Making Music! In Emacs?! by Zachary Kanfer</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jOGZPvV-5k</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jOGZPvV-5k">youtube</a><br><br>Making Music! In Emacs?! by Zachary Kanfer

  During quarantine, I found myself spending time with an Android app. One of the features this app has is composing music that loops endlessly. As with many programs, I wondered how much better this feature would be, if only it was inside Emacs. This talk explains how I made zmusic, my implementation inside Emacs, with detours through Emacs text properties, font rendering, the WAVE file format, and music theory. And hopefully at the end, we’ll have something worth listening to.

  Zachary spends a lot of time coding Lisp, playing guitars, and doing improv. He also runs Emacs NYC, and recently got into hats. Find him at zck.org.</div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596bm1hTscs">youtube</a><br><br>On this edition of "Hey DT!" ...
  0:00 Intro
  0:20 Have you ever used a dating site? If so, how did you describe yourself on your profile?
  1:22  What makes mainline versions of Linux distros different to each other?
  2:41 Would you still be using emacs if there was no Doom Emacs?
  5:13 Make a video on how to setup and use wm on a laptop where all f keys are bind to functions like brightness and all.
  7:31 What do you select when your AUR helper asks to "Remove make dependencies after install?"
  8:28 IF there is a Microphone in the room, assume it is ON.
  10:47 Do you know any pc vendor that build a pc/laptop without os installed. What is that AVA logo behind you?
  12:25 Just noticed some bot pretending to be you replying to comments (remember folks, DT wouldn't promote proprietary garbage like WhatsApp)
  14:51 Do you think that Canonical have cleaned up their act? How do you feel about them as far as "free as in freedom" goes?
  19:46 Thanks to the Patrons.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqZd5N71-I8">youtube</a><br><br>In this video I describe how I made the emacs package ido-numbered-mode, in only a few days, with zero knowledge of emacs lisp.

  This video is in part a tutorial for emacs lisp, and in part a tutorial for software engineering in general.

  It's designed to help people that hear "the code is the documentation" or "just read the codebase" or are first joining a project with a big codebase and are lost/don't know how to start or don't know how to ramp up when reading a big codebase.

  This should help you figure out how to quickly learn the context for new engineering projects and environments.

      <title>Emacs as a Kotlin IDE | It&apos;s awesome!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4s3T0dd5CY</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4s3T0dd5CY">youtube</a><br><br>In this video we showcase using Emacs as a Kotlin IDE, using packages like lsp-mode with kotlin-language-server. Some of the features are not that well documented, so you might learn about new ones in this video :) Some gotchas are relevant for other languages using lsp-mode as well, like the renaming and code actions parts. yasnippet is useful for Rust programming with rustic as well! :)

  If you have problems debugging: Remember to rebuild your project with Maven or Gradle!!! Should probably have mentioned this in the video, but forgot :(

  So finally I am able to generate big contracts with only few lines of code. The whole process is super simple using org mode combining both macro replacement and include option in my org files.

      <title>Org mode - Macro replacement, variables in org files</title>

  When writing big documents you may want to use macro replacements, they are like variables which will be replaced by the global value on export. Saves lot of time and helps you in creating consistent documents.

      <title>Come gestire un blog</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQsghMNSymc</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQsghMNSymc">youtube</a><br><br>In questo video discuto l'articolo How I manage my blog in cui faccio vedere come gestisco il mio blog tramite hugo, emacs e ox-hugo. La pipeline che utilizzo ha tre step: gestisco il contenuto dei post in un file org-mode tramite emacs, utilizzo il pacchetto ox-hugo per esportare i vari post in relativi file markdown, e infine utilizzo hugo per esportare i file markdown nei file html, css e javascript che vanno poi a formare il sito statico finale.

  Nel video menziono anche un concetto importante che purtroppo molto spesso dimentichiamo: è importante conoscere bene la potenza degli strumenti che utilizziamo in modo da scegliere lo strumento più appropriato per il task da risolvere. Non c'è bisogno sempre di scegliere strumento più potente, perché il potere può si aiutare in tanti contesti, ma può anche creare danni in tanti altri contesti, specialmente nel mondo dell'informatica e dunque della sicurezza informatica.

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6tGvwp-Ayk</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6tGvwp-Ayk">youtube</a><br><br>Learning the basics, getting started with customizing Emacs to fit your needs.  Your needs will be different, unique to your workflow and preferences.  Emacs can meet you where you are.  You just need to do some customizing.  In this video, we will go through an easy path to getting started.

  I recommend getting started learning what comes out of the box before you start customizing.  You won't be able to learn everything, just the basics, and at some point you will find a need to customize something small, the like a variable, and you can start to re-design elements of the program around your work.

      <title>Learn the Basics of the Dired File Manager (Doom Emacs)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ_3L702n7w">youtube</a><br><br>This tutorial will cover some of the basic commands and customization options of '"dired", the file manager inside Emacs.  This video will focus on dired within Doom Emacs, using the evil keybindings (vim-like keybindings).   Although this video is nearly 30 minutes long, it barely scratches the surface of the functionality available within this excellent file manager!

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRjZ3NUT9JE">youtube</a><br><br>In this live-coding session, we'll begin creating a package. The idea behind the package is to easily display and create reference cards in a temporary buffer. As I'm coding, I'm learning about interactive mode, creating windows and buffers programmatically, keymaps, and more.

  It had been a while since I recorded one of these videos and I didn't have the aspect ratio of my Emacs window quite right—thus the blank space on the right. I'll try to remember this next time and have the Emacs window fill the entire screen.

  Note that this isn't a tutorial necessarily as I'm learning as I'm going. Instead, this is a look inside the process I use to learn new concepts and put them into practice.

  Let me know if you'd like to see more of this type of video!

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCmyMCfmUhQ">youtube</a><br><br>In today's stream, we'll take a look at the EIEIO library for Emacs Lisp to learn how you might write object-oriented code for your configuration or custom packages.  This library is based on the Common Lisp Object System, so if you've got a general interest in Lisp you'll want to check this out!

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nshi4FSYQ8</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nshi4FSYQ8">youtube</a><br><br>In this stream we create an Emacs major mode for our unnamed language, that way we have syntax highlighting and basic editor support from Emacs. This took longer than I expected, and I became frustrated with Emacs' lack of documentation on the one feature the entire editor is based on (modes). We do eventually get it working. After this, we decide to alter how functions are parsed in order to (hopefully) have less code duplication and better semantics when it comes to parsing types of function parameters, as well as the function return type itself. This is (like it sounds) kind of a giant task, so we don't finish this in this video, and end up getting stuck at a bug near the end of the stream. Luckily, we've figured out what the bug was caused by, and we will begin next stream by fixing the bug and moving on with our lives :^).

  I do want to say I'm sorry for this stream :/. I feel like I didn't bring the proper mindset to the stream and I don't like how I treated some of the viewers and chatters while I was frustrated. It is something I will do my best to be better at; you viewers don't deserve having to listen to me yell at my computer screen why it's not working :p. I thank any and all of you for watching, and hope you can forgive me for forgetting the number one reason we are here: "be excellent to each other, and party on, dudes!".  Honestly, I'm even embarrassed to post this video, and I wish I could just sweep it under the rug with no one noticing; alas, the video is part of the development of the compiler and therefore must be published. It would be kind of nonsense to just start tomorrow's stream like this one never happened, and I don't think it would be respectful to those who watched live. \endrant :/

  As always, thank you to all those who were able to make it live, and to all watching in the future. You are why I'm still here.   -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/lens_r

      <title>Emacs: Cursores Múltiples, Árbol de Deshacer, Use Package (español argentino)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sQnx4uVe7s</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sQnx4uVe7s">youtube</a><br><br>Veamos un repaso de algunos de los paquetes que más nos pueden ayudar. Multiple Cursors permite editar múltiples lugares a la vez. En este video, creo dos funciones en Emacs Lisp para proveer una funcionalidad más intuitiva usando las funciones de multiple-cursors. Undo Tree persiste el historial de deshacer entre sesiones y provee una manera gráfica muy intuitiva de deshacer y rehacer en un árbol de estados. Use Package nos permite automatizar la instalación y configuración de paquetes; lo ponemos en marcha para transformar un .emacs.d en un repositorio de Git fácil de descargar y usar en una instalación nueva de Emacs.

  Notas de este video:
   - Casi al final, las listas de multiple-cursors no quedaron configuradas en el repositorio que descarga los paquetes automáticamente. Esto fue (como sospechaba) porque el comando 'cp' no copió el archivo. Esto no ocurre al clonar el repositorio, que además es la mejor práctica (o usando bien cp|rsync).
   - Use Package tiene otra opción muy útil que no me di cuenta de comentar, y es defer, que permite retrasar la carga del paquete hasta que estés inactivo por N segundos. Otra es ensure-system-package, que permite llamar al gestor de paquetes del sistema para instalar un programa. Una última es disabled, que permite desactivar todo un bloque de use-package. Todas estas cosas, verlas en https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package.

      <title>introducción a EMACS (Tutorial)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n15j9a_h_f0</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n15j9a_h_f0">youtube</a><br><br>Pequeña introducción al editor de código EMACS. Aunque se trata de un editor más bien antigua, emacs presenta algunas características interesantes, como su flexibilidad y adaptabilidad. Este editor se basa en el lenguaje Lisp ("LISt Processor", o "Procesamiento de Listas"). En este vídeo, veremos cómo movernos por el archivo de código, como copiar y pegar texto, cómo navegar por otros archivos desde la misma ventana o cómo buscar y reemplazar cadenas de texto.

  ¡ Esperamos que este contenido te sirva y sea de tu interés !


  Si te interesa el tema del diseño de veleros, no dejes de visitar esta web: https://navalapp.com
  Allí encontrarás una comunidad muy activa e interesada en este tema, además de varios cursos sobre diseño de embarcaciones a vela:

  1) Curso sobre diseño de veleros: https://navalapp.com/courses/sailing-yacht-design-1/
  Este curso incluye teoría y práctica sobre el embarcaciones a vela. Usando Maxsurf, realizaremos el diseño de una carena y sus apéndices. Además aprenderemos a hacer el cálculo de resistencia al avance y la estabilidad, también usando Maxsurf.

  2) Curso sobre escantillonado de veleros con ISO-12215: https://navalapp.com/courses/scantling-with-iso-12215/
  Este curso trata de la aplicación de la norma ISO 12215 al escantillonado de estructuras de veleros. Se trata de un curso eminentemente práctico, donde aprenderás los detalles de la norma ISO 12215 a través del ejemplo con un barco concreto. Para ese barco, se calcularán el escantillonado a través de ejemplos a mano y utilizando el software SCT. El curso incluye una licencia temporal gratuita de este software. Más información sobre el software SCT aquí: http://www.boatscantlings.com

  Además de estos, podrás encontrar otros cursos de otros temas relacionados con el mundo de las embarcaciones a vela. De estos cursos no somos nosotros los autores pero son igual de interesantes.


  Aparte de eso, en Matemáticas y barcos nos interesa el tema de los CFD en general, y su aplicación a la ingeniería naval, en particular. Sobre este tema, podrás encontrar también un par de cursos de los que somos autores:

  3) Curso sobre OpenFoam: https://ingeoexpert.com/cursos/curso-de-simulacion-numerica-de-fluidos-con-openfoam/
  En este curso aprenderás los rudimentos del CFD OpenFoam a través de varios ejemplos de aplicación:  "Cavity", los problemas de Couette y Poiselle, un perfil aerodinámico y un Dam Break.

  4) Curso sobre CFD para aplicaciones navales (OpenFoam):
  https://ingenierojorgejuan.com/es/c/109/simulacion-numerica-para-aplicaciones-navales
  En este curso podrás aprender algunas aplicaciones más avanzadas centradas en casos de interés práctico en ingeniería naval. Estos casos son:
  - Un ensayo de remolque.
  - Un ensayo de propulsor aislado, es decir: la simulación del flujo en una hélice para obtener sus curvas de funcionamiento.
  - Un ensayo de plataforma flotante en olas.

      <title>Automating Tasks with Emacs Lisp - System Crafters Live!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zvE2vZEPzs</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zvE2vZEPzs">youtube</a><br><br>In today's stream, we'll automate a particular task that I don't find very fun: editing YouTube video descriptions.  We'll use Emacs Lisp to interact with the YouTube Data API to pull down a video's description, edit it in a buffer, and then save the description back to the video! If you thought Emacs Lisp was only for major and minor modes, this might prove that it can do a whole lot more.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=X8c_TrGfYcM">youtube</a><br><br>Ever considered using Emacs instead of tmux? Neither did I - before tmux starting crashing on me. In this video, I show you how I've replaced tmux with Emacs:
  - named, dedicated shell buffers for specific apps with shell-mode
  - running rich TUI apps like top and vim inside Emacs using vterm
  - having multiple vterm buffers with multi-vterm

      <title>Why Do I Choose Emacs Over Vim? It Looks Better!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-XU55ZIVak</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-XU55ZIVak">youtube</a><br><br>I spent a couple of hours today playing with my Doom Emacs config.  In particular, I focused on some font settings which I think help with aesthetics and with readability.  In fact, I think one of the biggest reasons that I use Emacs over Vim is how Emacs renders fonts.

      <title>Emacs Long Lines Fix</title>

  ----
  Precepts of "Programming In the Small":

  1. MIMO: Minimal Impact, Maximum Obfuscation

  Write an excruciatingly specified if-statement to isolate the
  conditions under which the misbehavior occurred.  That way, you've
  limited any fallout to that singular scenario.  Then justify the
  hamhanded fix with a long comment.  2a1fe083, 7792f7b, eef185d,
  2e7402b, bedb3cb, 83218cf4, ....

  2. Ponzi Compounding

  Parent hacks beget child hacks to sustain their parents.  289b457.
  This ensures programs already incomprehensible only become more so.

  3. Don't Touch Anything in the Incan Tomb

  Swashbuckling archaeologists and programmers would do well not to
  disturb, much less *gasp* remove, gold idols from their ancient
  resting places.

  4. The Macgruber Conjecture

  Never cut a wire that's been around long enough.

  5. Bottomless suitcase preservationism

  Pack your entire shoe closet.  They might have snowshoeing down in the
  Caribbean.  Same goes for code comments.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Write Everything In Emacs Org Mode? You NEED This Plugin!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FzMPZm7vY</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FzMPZm7vY">youtube</a><br><br>In the last couple of years, I have really started to write everything in Org Mode.  Whether it be articles, documentation, scripts, programming...I use Org for all of it.   But, there is one thing that kind of bugged me, especially with my literate programming using Org.  I hated having to constantly run org-babel-tangle to export my files.   I found a solution!

      <title>Emacs Org Mode - Navigation</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdtIB_VaMh8</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdtIB_VaMh8">youtube</a><br><br>Here are some tips for navigating an emacs org mode file. I cover the following:
  - Easily copying/pasting code blocks
  - Easily copying/pasting sections
  - Searching for strings (C-s)
  - Jumping to a line in the document (M-x goto-line)

  Some helpful Emacs key bindings:
  TAB - collapse expand section, code block, caption, figure, etc.
  C-a - go to beginning of line
  C-[SPACE] - set mark
  C-e - go to end of line
  M-w - copy selected text
  C-y - paste (Emacs: "yank") selected text from clipboard (Emacs: "kill ring")

  Not discussed here:
  C-k - "cut" (Emacs: "kill") selected text

  For more information about Emacs, see:
  Introduction to Emacs - https://youtu.be/ZMEcb2rpauU

  0:00 Start
  0:45 - Collapse, copy, and paste a collapsed code block
  1:45 - Collapse, copy and paste an org section
  2:26 - Searching (C-s)
  3:54 - Goto line</div>]]></description>

   I also briefly show a number of packages I thing are a must for serious coding:
  - projectile for project navigation and search
  - magit for git
  - subword-mode
  - yasnippet for code snippets

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37H7bD-G7nE&pp=ygUFZW1hY3M%3D">youtube</a><br><br>Many Vim users find Doom Emacs overwhelming at first, because of the orgy of documentation.  There is so much to learn!  Don't worry.  You don't need to learn everything on Day One.  If you already have a strong foundation with Vim commands, then you are almost ready for Doom Emacs.  But here's a few other things you need to know on Day One.

      <title>Using Emacs to start a project build within a Windows VM.</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/4Nglvarhx9k</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtu.be/4Nglvarhx9k">youtube</a><br><br>This video covers an elisp snippet that starts its evaluation life cycle by yanking the entire current buffer and then proceeding to call a bash script that runs xdotool operations to find and bring to focus a QEMU/KVM Windows 10 guest, thereafter it continues to send the following key combos:
  Ctrl+A (Select all - presumably the source text in your editor within the Win10 VM)
  Backspace (Delete all the old text)
  Paste (It pastes the previously yanked contents)
  Finally the script sends the F11 key which executes a compile and run command within the IDE that I am required to use (Dev-C++).

  The script has some hard dependencies on a QEMU/KVM Windows 10 LTSC VM (It's the leanest SKU in my opinion) running under X11 and your Window Manager (in this case; IceWM) being EWMH compliant enough to allow switching to the QEMU/KVM window and activating it (bringing it to the front), additionally you must ensure that your editor source page is left focused in the VM otherwise when the script switches to the VM it will paste the clipboard contents into whatever else was left focused prior.

      <title>Pict2e-lua: a library for diagrams that is being developed with eev and test blocks</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiHsUhGVLGM</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiHsUhGVLGM">youtube</a><br><br>See: http://angg.twu.net/pict2e-lua.html

  00:00
  00:14  Page: http://angg.twu.net/pict2e-lua.html
  00:39  The Try it!: has two eepitch blocks
  00:52  has a link to the definition of eepitch block
  00:56  copy the eepitch blocks to a temporary buffer
  01:10  these bullets are equivalent to red stars
  01:18  let's run these eepitch blocks...
  01:49  these lines install Debian packages
  01:59  I will explain this setenv later
  02:07  this clones the github repository
  02:19  # (find-fline ...)
  02:33  /tmp/pict2e-lua/edrxlib.lua
  02:50  my init file for Lua - for pretty-printing
  03:01  the setenv makes Lua use my init file
  03:12  # (code-c-d ...) defines lots of functions
  03:15  including find-pict2elua
  03:22  # (find-pict2elua ...) opens a Lua file
  03:30  Here is one of these Lua files
  03:32  here is a kind of index of the file
  03:34  some of these links point to tests
  03:38  For example if we follow this link here
  03:42  we go to a test block, and we can execute
  03:44  this test block with a series of f8s.
  03:49  The f8s create a target buffer running Lua
  03:55  creates data structures and prints them
  04:03  There's one thing that is very tricky
  04:20  in some of the tests we need to show the PDF
  04:25  a command that splits the screen in three
  04:33  the command that does that is (etv)
  04:40  this header contains two blocks of one-liners
  04:50  and we need to execute all the sexps in
  04:53  the second one
  04:56  I'm going to execute them with M-7 M-e
  04:58  that is equivalent to M-e down.
  05:11  The last test in this file calls (etv)
  05:20  the first part of the test is very easy
  05:24  nothing special - it just sends commands
  05:26  to Lua - but then we have this line here
  05:29  that calls a class called Show, that saves
  05:36  some TeX code to a .tex file and runs
  05:38  latex to compile it and to generate a PDF
  05:42  the important thing is that this takes
  05:46  several seconds to run and we need to wait
  05:59  until it says blah blah blah Success!!!
  06:02  then we can run this (etv) here, and it
  06:05  shows a drawing - a bounding box in yellow.
  06:15  In Pict2e1.lua the drawings are not very
  06:18  interesting - this is just the core library
  06:24  Let me show how to draw the orbit.
  06:40  This defun here defines the function `a'
  06:43  as a function that opens the first Lua
  06:45  file - with the core definitions - and `b'
  06:48  defines b as the function that opens the
  06:50  second Lua file with some extra classes
  06:54  and some stranger drawings.
  06:56  So let's execute `b', and go to
  07:09  Plot2D-test2.
  07:12  So here we have a test block -
  07:16  it's quite big - it defines...
  07:19  it changes the preamble,
  07:21  it defines several functions, it uses some
  07:24  classes that are defined in this file...
  07:28  and then after printing the TeX code
  07:32  it has this line here that contains a
  07:34  show. If I execute to this line it takes a few
  07:38  seconds... it says Success!!! and now we can
  07:40  show the .pdf. And: ta-da!
  07:44  this is the figure that I wanted to show.
  07:47  So, that's it. Again: this is a
  07:53  library that is not interesting in
  07:55  itself, but
  07:56  i think that the way in which it can be
  07:58  tested - which is very similar to the way
  08:01  in which I'm developing it
  08:03  is interesting in itself - so
  08:05  if you are interested in test blocks
  08:08  please test this,
  08:10  and send feedback. That's it! bye =)</div>]]></description>

This could be useful if you need to ask a help/support question related to the project you are working on.  Or maybe you just want to get away from your work for a bit and relax with some chat.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMDAztg_II">youtube</a><br><br>Veremos en este vídeo un (no tan breve) recorrido informal por un documento de Org-Mode, para mostrar funcionalidades como la navegabilidad entre nodos plegables, el sistema de enlaces, las notas, los bloques de código o las tablas. Org no es sólo un lenguaje de marcado ligero sino un potente y completo entorno de trabajo integrado en GNU Emacs. ¡Y todo en texto plano!

      <title>MTL workflow (preprocessing japanese text, using deepl and then  emacs mtl mode for post edits)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plr_tdNSdtM</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plr_tdNSdtM">youtube</a><br><br>This video is a demo of different tools I made for making MTL, it can make doing the translation easier for me, so I'm hoping it does that to others too.

  Here are the programs:
  Preprocessing Script: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/mtl-related-scripts
  Jisho-Chibi: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/jisho-chibi
  Mtl-edit-mode: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/emacs-modules

  Preprocessing will process the text so deepl gives better translations, make less mistakes for the names and so on.

  Jisho chibi is Qt interface for jisho.org website.

  Mtl-edit mode is minor mode for emacs. It has functions to help edit the mtls.</div>]]></description>

      <title>20,000 Page Static Website Written In Org Mode</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH8rieN7aRI</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH8rieN7aRI">youtube</a><br><br>The distro.tube website has been up for a couple of years.  It is a static website written in Org mode in Emacs.  Until yesterday, it was about 50 pages.  I decided to add another 21,000 pages to the site.  Why?  Because I wanted to see how viable it is to maintain such a large static website using Emacs and 'org-publish' .

      <title>Data Analysis with Emacs Org Mode: Tables and AWK Source Blocks</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km5nXENXEQE</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km5nXENXEQE">youtube</a><br><br>In this video I do some simple data analysis for my lab students using org-mode in Emacs. First I construct some very simple tables, and then I write some AWK code blocks to average the data across replicates. In the next video I'm going to show how I took that data, calculated a trend line with Python and then plotted it with gnuplot.

  I also tried out some video editing to trim the parts where I was fumbling around in man pages. The transitions are a bit rough (I used ffmpeg, which probably justifies its own video), but I cut out about 20 minutes. Hopefully that makes the video a bit more palatable.

      <title>Emacs Minibuffer Completions</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9hHMDyF9V4</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9hHMDyF9V4">youtube</a><br><br>This video explores Emacs minibuffer completions.

  What are completions? The user types an argument fragment, and Emacs suggests possible completions for that fragment. Completions make emacs faster and easier for the user.

  Examples of when completions are used:
    Run command (M-x)
    Switch buffer (C-x b)
    Find file (C-x C-f)
    Get info (C-h R)
    Etc.

  Vertico is a nice Completion UI.

  The full list of standard completion styles are provided by the variable completion-styles-alist.
    orderless
    emacs21
    emacs22
    basic
    partial-completion
    substring
    flex
    initials

  You can set the completion styles you want to use with the variable completion-styles.
  (setq completion-styles '(basic substring orderless))

  Question: Since we're providing a list of styles, which one is used? Answer: Emacs will use the first style that produces results.

  Question: How do I know how each style behaves? Answer: Use just one style and see how it behaves. Or read the Info Manual.

  Question: Why does emacs prepend styles to the front of my completion-styles list? Answer: Emacs has a set of category styles that it prepends by default (see completion-category-defaults). You can override the defaults (see completion-category-overrides).

  To learn more, see the Help for the variable above or see the Emacs code in minibuffer.el.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Emacs from Source Part 4: IDE Features with lsp-mode, company-mode, and go-mode</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFPD7icMoHY</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFPD7icMoHY">youtube</a><br><br>In this video I put together a basic setup for IDE-style features like code completion, linting, and code actions for languages that support the Language Server Protocol inside of Emacs. I also added which-key to help with keybindings and flycheck-mode to help with displaying the warnings and errors from lsp-mode. After this general configuration, I add my Go-specific configuration and test it out on a minimal example program. I also add some extra code analyzers to lsp-go and set up a global binding for compilation.

  Now that we lsp-mode and company-mode ready to go, put your suggestions for future languages in the comments! I'm already planning to do Python and Rust, but I could try to figure out some others as well.

  01:34 Mapping Caps Lock to Control with xmodmap
  02:47 lsp-mode
  06:10 which-key
  07:55 company-mode
  11:10 Using company for emacs-lisp-mode
  15:00 go-mode
  27:00 Trying it out
  28:27 Trying it out successfuly
  32:40 Fixing lsp-command-map binding
  34:24 Binding recompile to F5

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctve_PpjcCc">youtube</a><br><br>Título: Introducción a Linux. M11. Operaciones con emacs.


  Descripción automática: En este video, se muestra cómo realizar operaciones básicas en Emacs para el trabajo diario. Se comienza abriendo y ajustando el tamaño de fuente de un archivo para trabajar más cómodamente. Luego, se explica cómo buscar una cadena de texto dentro del archivo y reemplazar múltiples apariciones de esta cadena con otra.

  Para eliminar líneas, se enseña el uso de comandos específicos y cómo cortar un rango de líneas y pegarlas en otra parte del archivo. Además, se demuestra cómo trabajar con múltiples ventanas, cambiar entre ellas y abrir diferentes archivos en cada buffer.

  El video también aborda la edición de archivos protegidos, indicando que no se pueden hacer cambios si no se tienen los permisos adecuados. Finalmente, se muestra cómo guardar las ediciones y cerrar el programa, incluyendo consejos para el uso eficiente de la tecla Control, comúnmente utilizada en Emacs, y cómo asignarla a otra tecla más accesible para mayor comodidad.

This is done with an initialization file that Emacs picks up when starting, from the $HOME location on your PC.

  The video covers download of the .emacs file from the web, and opening Emacs with or without it, finding the $HOME directory. In another video, I explain how to download Emacs packages with the package manager, and how to change the layout.

  - Get the .emacs file from the web: https://tinyurl.com/lyonemacs
  - Test installation: restart emacs - you should see no menu or tool bar at the top (the init file that you just installed contains commands to switch them off).

This video shows how to create a simple Org-mode file, define a C code block, run the file inside Emacs, extract C source code from the Org-mode file, and run it on the CMD line terminal. See also: assignment in GitHub.

  Conditions: you must have the GCC compiler MinGW installed and in the PATH, and you must have my .emacs file loaded by Emacs.

  - Create a working directory with C-x d followed by + and the name
  - Create an Org-mode file (.org) with C-x C-f first.org RET
  - Font change with C-x C-= followed by + or - or 0
  - Meta information always begins with #+

  -Org-mode links are surrounded by [[ and ]]
  - To name the code block use #+name:
  - Code block begins with #+begin_src, and ends with #+end_src
  - You need to add a header (minimum: programming language, e.g. C)
  - Add the statement inside the block
  - To execute the code block use C-c C-c (with the cursor anywhere inside the block)
  - To mark a region, use C-SPC

  Conditions: you must have bash.exe installed and in the PATH of your PC so that it can be found by Emacs. You must have GNU Emacs installed. You must have my sample .emacs file loaded by Emacs.

  To install the bash.exe shell program, download and install CygWin, a suite of utility programs for Windows from here: https://cygwin.com/install.html

  - Make sure you have bash shell: open eshell inside Emacs (M-x eshell) and enter the command  "which bash". On Windows, you should get the location of the file bash.exe
  - Create a code source block for the language bash in an Org-mode file.
  - Add a bash statement: echo hello world
  - Run the code block with C-c C-c. You should see the output.
  - Next, create a file hello.sh which has in its first line the code #![path to bash.exe]. Get the [path to bash.exe] from the shell with which bash.
  - Save the file and run it in the eshell with ./hello.sh.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Emacs from Source Part 2: vertico, orderless, and marginalia</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4911q_SnGDU</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4911q_SnGDU">youtube</a><br><br>In this video we continue the Emacs From Source series by setting up the completion system vertico for Emacs, along with a new completion-style from the orderless package, and some completion UI enhancements from marginalia. I also take care of the annoying backup and auto-save files popping up everywhere, turn off the menu-, tool-, and scroll-bars, and set a visible region color.

  Timestamps:
  00:00 Introduction
  01:40 Brief look at defaults and ido-mode
  03:38 Hiding backup and auto-save files
  08:20 Installing vertico
  10:11 Installing orderless
  12:15 Struggling with read-buffer-completion-ignore-case*
  13:55 Installing marginalia
  15:30 Setting region color
  17:32 Turning off bars

  *I did eventually figure out the problem with read-buffer-completion-ignore-case. If you have an exact match, obviously vertico will select that. The situation I encountered the other day was more like "long buffer name including messages" and that was getting matched instead of *Messages*. Setting this variable to t does fix that situation. I just picked a bad example.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9kg9yVMMAM">youtube</a><br><br>In this video I walk through my personal setup showing how Chrome, Emacs/Org-mode and LogSeq can be tied together via the BrainTool browser extension.
  See more details at https://braintool.org

  BrainTool is a free and open source browser bookmark tool that makes it easy to add notes to your bookmarks, organize them into a topic hierarchy and then use that hierarchy to open and close groups of tabs and thus control your browser. It is unique as a bookmark manager in that it is designed to interoperate as part of a larger system of personal knowledge management and productivity tools.
  It achieves this interoperability by saving your data into an accessible plain text file written in the emacs standard org-mode format. Org mode is a set of plain text tools used to manage tasks, to do lists, notes, links, journal entries and almost any form of text-based information.

  Most org mode users interact with it via the emacs text editor but it can be used in any text editor and is increasingly used as a format by other tools such as the LogSeq* personal knowledge manager, the Flat Habits iOS ToDo manager and Plain Org an iOS org-mode editor.

  Here I show how the notes, links and todo items captured by BrainTool in your browser can be accessed and edited in org mode and then used to drive a task manager. The same plain text file is also shown synced to LogSeq and being navigated in the LogSeq user interface.

  All three tools are automatically kept in sync by virtue of using the same org mode file as backing store. Currently this requires syncing BrainTool to a Google Drive file and using the Google Sync app to sync your GDrive to a desktop folder. Emacs and LogSeq can then read and write the BrainTool data file locally. Some care needs to be taken to allow time for the local and remote files to sync before moving between tools.

  If you are new to BrainTool the other videos in this playlist give a short introduction.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Vim And Emacs Are The Most Important Skills You Should Learn</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8ZOnz0x9UM</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8ZOnz0x9UM">youtube</a><br><br>I often get viewers asking me about what skills they should learn to become a "power user" or "elite."  While there are so many important skills that one could learn, I think the two most important programs that every Linux user owes it to themselves to learn are Vim and Emacs.

      <title>Magit: Boot Your Git Productivity in Emacs</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/cxJeyPZQGNI</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtu.be/cxJeyPZQGNI">youtube</a><br><br>📺 In this video, I will show you the intuitive and productive workflow (clone/stage/branch/log/push, etc.) of Magit, one of the killer apps in Emacs. It's the best Git client.

  💡 The Emacs version I demonstrated here is 27.2, and I didn't customize anything of Magit. It just runs well out of the box. Install magit as below:
  #+begin_src elisp
  (require 'package)

  (setq package-archives
        '(("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/")))

  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-initialize)
  (package-install 'magit)
  #+end_src

  📖 Reference:

  - ppcompile: https://github.com/whatacold/ppcompile

   This series would be all about setting up an editor from scratch and build all the features that we need using the rich ecosystem of GNU/Emacs.

  I'm going to share my experience in creating my own editor based on Emacs which is going to be 12 years old today.  So stay tune for more episodes :)

      <title>Emacs 29: Typing Emoji characters was never so easy!✌️</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=e2lHLRT4nlk</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=e2lHLRT4nlk">youtube</a><br><br>📺 In this video, I will show you the sweet feature of Emoji typing that Lars Ingebrightsen brought to Emacs 29 a month ago.

  💡 The Emacs version I built here is 29.0.50, and the Git version is f1116f45bcabc5628e7443a2c792971c7c23b8b1.

  🛠️ If you want to build Emacs yourself, follow the INSTALL instructions: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/INSTALL

  📝 Lars Ingebrightsen's blog post: https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2021/10/28/emacs-emojis-a-%e2%9d%a4%ef%b8%8f-story/

  The title I was typing (at 48 second of this video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2lHLRT4nlk&t=0m48s ) while recording the video should be "Typing emoji characters in Emacs was never so easy!", sorry!

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqdT0xKMQT8">youtube</a><br><br>In this stream, we'll experiment with the latest improvements to the Tab Bar feature in Emacs 28 to see if we can make it a good replacement for workspace packages like Perspective.el.  We'll also take a look at a really valuable use case for it that you probably haven't considered!

      <title>Setting up Emacs for Front End Development</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9GcNrhx-iE</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9GcNrhx-iE">youtube</a><br><br>In this video I show you how I setup #Emacs for #frontenddevelopment (#html, #css, and #javascript). I first inhibit the startup screen and inhibit any potential cl warnings, before hiding the tool bar. After that we install the following packages: js2-mode, emmet-mode, markdown-mode, web mode, and prettier. We also turn on electric pair mode.

  After that we install the following themes - atom one dark, material, gruvbox, and dracula. After installing these packages and themes we configure our init.el to support our new packages. Note: during this process we use terminal emacs.

      <title>Getting Evil (aka Vim keys) in Emacs without Doom Emacs</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C9GbmIP1EA</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C9GbmIP1EA">youtube</a><br><br>This tutorial is focused on getting Vim style keys in Emacs without having to install Doom Emacs. With the rise in Emacs distros I have seen a rise in reliance on them to avoid learning Emacs. While I am all for people using what works for them I wanted to make a video to help those who want to learn vanilla Emacs while still keeping Vim keys everywhere.

  Use-package Config:
      https://gist.github.com/Gavinok/38975384c4a46c291103e7b220dc25e9

  Install Use-package config
  NOTE: this will overwrite your current Emacs configuration

  ```sh
  mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d && curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Gavinok/38975384c4a46c291103e7b220dc25e9/raw/d038d398dc760e7270fbbcb3d7233dca8cbca2d6/init.el -o ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  ```

  NO Use-package Config:
      https://gist.github.com/Gavinok/5ba21492b66b6765384cf43d9b836847

  Install NO Use-package config

  ```sh

  ```

  Let me know what you think and if there is anything specific you would like to learn about.

  Bala Ramadurai

  Ye Freelance warriors, please lend me your I/O devices for 5 minutes.

  Your time is your money! Do you find it a pain to generate an invoice, record the details into your accounting software and keep track of taxes and payments? You are not alone, I found the whole invoice thingy to be extremely painful.

  But worry not, Emacs comes to our rescue.

  My talk will give you a basic intro on how to use org mode, some embedded python code and file jugglery to generate stylistic and professional invoices.

  What you will learn during the session:

  How to track your freelance time using orgmode
  How to create the basic infrastructure for invoice generation
  How to generate the invoice
  How to manage multiple clients
  How to enter the finance details into your accounting software
  How to track invoice payments
  We will use the following packages:

  Emacs+orgmode (duh?)
  yasnippet
  python layer (I use spacemacs, so whatever is the equivalent in your config)

Much of the presentation was theoretical, though I also covered some personal experiences from my participation in the Emacs community.

  The text of the presentation is available on my website: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-10-29-live-stream-impostor-syndrome-emacs/

  After I concluded my presentation, I joined the live chat to answer questions or to comment on statements from the participants.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDgpXbjeMeo">youtube</a><br><br>📺 Keyboard macro is a nice text editing feature of Emacs, in this video, I will show you how to use it to make a numbered list quickly in 2 steps:
  1. Hit F3 to start defining a macro, and edit the text as usual, then hit F4 to end the definition.
  2. Hit F4 to apply the macro.

  Numbered lists are common in org-mode or markdown text, so this feature could help.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Qe0vHK2Z0">youtube</a><br><br>Pada video ini dijelaskan bagaimana cara untuk membuat init file untuk Emacs.


  Init file untuk Emacs disimpan dengan nama init.el. File ini disimpan di
  ~/.emacs.d.


  Contoh pengaturan yang didemokan pada video ini adalah


  - menghilangkan pesan Emacs pada saat membuka aplikasi Emacs
  - menghubungkan Emacs dengan Melpa (package archives)
  - menyimpan custom variables di custom-file.el
  - install theme di Emacs

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4sK5ld6Bw0">youtube</a><br><br>Electronic notebooks are crucial in a digital world where almost everything is done with a computer. I created scimax-notebook to support my needs in an electronic notebook, including things like creating and opening notebooks, searching notebooks, and linking to notebooks. In this video I walk through how I use notebooks, what some of the features of scimax-notebook are, and walk through the code that implements it. This library is developed in a literate programming style using org-mode.

      <title>&quot;Type-Driven API Design in Rust&quot; by Will Crichton</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnnacleqg6k</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnnacleqg6k">youtube</a><br><br>Rust is a unique programming language that blends imperative and functional concepts to make low-level systems safer. However, compared to other modern languages, designing APIs in Rust requires a fundamentally different mindset -- for example, designing without classes or inheritance. In this talk, I will live-code the design of a simple Rust API. Through the evolution of the API, I will demonstrate how Rust’s type system (especially traits) can be used to design interfaces that cleanly compose with existing code, and that help API clients catch mistakes at compile-time.

      <title>Trying Out Doom Emacs</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwnCXA77pGY</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwnCXA77pGY">youtube</a><br><br>Emacs or EMACS is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as "the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor".

  Doom is a configuration framework for GNU Emacs tailored for Emacs bankruptcy veterans who want less framework in their frameworks, a modicum of stability (and reproducibility) from their package manager, and the performance of a hand rolled config (or better). It can be a foundation for your own config or a resource for Emacs enthusiasts to learn more about our favorite operating system.

      <title>scimax - Managing RSS feeds with Emacs and elfeed</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvWbUGx9U5E</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvWbUGx9U5E">youtube</a><br><br>Hundreds of blog posts, articles, etc. are produced every week that you might want to read. It is very hard to keep track of all of them! RSS feeds can be used to collect brief summaries of these which helps but often isn't quite enough. You need an RSS reader that can help prioritize the entries, and that makes it easy to do things with them, like open the full entry, email or capture information from them. Elfeed with Emacs provides exactly this tool, and it is fully extensible so you can plug in scoring tools. In this video I will show how I have used and extended elfeed to help keep up with things happening in Emacs and the scientific literature.

      <title>Magit: 3 Quick Ways to Revert Git Commits | Emacs Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D4cV0aodGw&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D4cV0aodGw&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Looking for a more productive and intuitive way to revert Git commits? This video is for you.

  In this video, I will demonstrate how to discard/revert Git commits in three ways, including:
  1. hard reset:
  2. revert
  3. soft reset

  Magit is one of the killer apps of Emacs, you should definitely give it a try, and you'll never look back to use the vanilla Git CLI.

  Reference:
  - Magit: https://magit.vc/
  - git reset: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset
  - git revert: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert

  Timeline:
  00:00 Intro
  00:40 Prepare a Git repo
  01:46 1. hard reset
  03:08 2. revert
  06:14 3. soft reset

      <title>&quot;Inverse Literate&quot; Emacs Configurations (Part 2) - Hack Sessions</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXu32MHBDqA</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXu32MHBDqA">youtube</a><br><br>In this stream, we'll take a brief detour from our usual EXWM hacking to experiment with an idea I had today: "inverse literate" Emacs configurations.  The major benefit of a literate configuration in Org Mode is that it can easily be converted into a readable form online.  However, editing such a configuration can be painful for various reasons.  Let's try to come up with a way to write our configuration purely in Emacs Lisp while still producing an Org file for publishing the configuration online!

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lpj2-pepPE">youtube</a><br><br>Did you know that the "info" system, nested deep within your computer, can expand and improve your knowledge of Emacs (and beyond)?!  It's not a joke, it's the real deal.  The Info system makes reading documentation as easy as a summer breeze.  Make some coffee or a hot tea and get cozy with your technical manuals.

      <title>Managing Email in Emacs with mu4e</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq6s3PwSwjo</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq6s3PwSwjo">youtube</a><br><br>A talk by Eric Collins

  You really enjoy doing everything in Emacs, editing text, managing all of your tasks, playing games like 2048, or building presentations, but do you read your email there? There are lots of options to choose from, but we’ll focus on setting up mu4e for seamless indexing and reading. This will include setting up supporting software that makes this all work together seamlessly to process your email.

  Bringing email into familiar keybindings dramatically improves your ability to read and process messages. It’s so helpful, you might just very well be able to achieve inbox zero.

  Topics that will be covered:

  - Locally caching messages using mbsync
  - Reading/indexing email with mu/mu4e
  - Sending email using msmtp
  - Attachments
  - Signing/Encrypting email using PGP</div>]]></description>

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMP8JjmS3ds</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMP8JjmS3ds">youtube</a><br><br>This is Part 2 of the Friday stream after I crashed it by killing OBS by accident!

  The first part is here: https://youtu.be/PE714pm1kvE

  In this stream, we'll dig into Emacs history and take a look at some of the variants that have come and gone over the years.  I'm not an expert in Emacs history so I'm hoping some of you will be able to help fill in the gaps!

  Recorded on November 2, 2020

  Raymond presented his notebook software that uses Emacs to bring
  together multiple programs to make a single set of computations. It's
  able to pass data back and forth between these programs, generate
  results, and even output publication-quality documents. Raymond
  referenced a previous EmacsNYC talk Evan Misshula gave about
  reproducible research: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGnt_PWoM5Y</div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y3MxU1YXdY">youtube</a><br><br>In this stream, we'll continue looking into the technical details of Emacs-driven desktop window management by reviewing the EXWM codebase.  We'll start by finishing up our test setup with Xephyr and figure out how to debug the XELB communication used by EXWM.  I'll also try to start fixing our first bug in the code base!

      <title>Live: Emacs note-taking and the mindful attitude</title>

The topic was in part about Emacs as a tool for increased productivity, though the takeaway is about the attitude we should maintain while approaching a new subject that we want to learn about. /// The text of the presentation is posted on my website: https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-08-31-emacs-second-brain-mindfulness/.

      <title>Emacs is More Than a Text Editor...</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiObW7xwQs">youtube</a><br><br>GNU Emacs is widely known as a text editor. However, it's much more than that. It has a web browser, a mail client, games, and even its own programming language called Emacs Lisp (a type of Lisp). It even has Tetris!

      <title>Emacs | Keeping a Journal In Org Mode</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pJESOo-z40</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pJESOo-z40">youtube</a><br><br>Keeping a journal with Org mode as your capture tool is super simple. You can't afford NOT to do it right now. Think of all the great things you can be capturing in an org mode journal. One journal (or many) coming up, no waiting. Keep track of reading notes, sketches, idea, code snippets, stories, activities, whatever you want. The power of Org mode is yours.

      <title>Rewriting My Website In Org Mode</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnogX7l7aKw</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnogX7l7aKw">youtube</a><br><br>In the last few days, I spent some time rewriting my website.  I wanted to move over to a completely Emacs/Org-based website where I write everything in Org mode and then use Org Publish to convert everything to HTML.  This is fantastic since I write everything in Org.  All of my past show notes that I wrote in Org can now be easily added to my website.

      <title>Emacs Macros | Save Time and Typing</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkdJRbwz-qw">youtube</a><br><br>WhY boTheR with Emacs anyway?  Some people like the freedom, some people like to show off, but most of us just want to save time --- and have fun doing it.  A great way to save time and typing is to -- USE VIM?  No, use macros in Emacs.  This video will introduce you to Emacs macros in practice and show how to do it yourself.  Emacs macros can be recorded and played back in the moment, or they can be stored later as Emacs Lisp functions.   So it's the best of both worlds. Learn a macro, save a macro, be a hero.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Introduction to Emacs Org Mode</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMEcb2rpauU</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMEcb2rpauU">youtube</a><br><br>It’s no stretch to say that Emacs Org could be the most powerful productivity software I’ve ever used. Emacs is *free* and very versatile.

  You can use Emacs org mode to:
  - write/publish documents and web pages
  - take mathematical/engineering/scientific notes, and even
  - embed executable computer programs in your documents
  - productivity
     - day planner
     - to-do list
     - contacts (“Rolodex”)

  Here, I provide an introduction to Emacs Org mode.

  Org documentation:
  Org home page - https://orgmode.org

  To obtain Emacs:
  GNU Emacs - https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
  Aquamacs - https://aquamacs.org

  Other Org introductions:
  - Org Mode is Awesome [J. Kitchin] - https://youtu.be/fgizHHd7nOo
  - Google Talk [C. Dominik, Org mode author] - https://youtu.be/oJTwQvgfgMM

  0:00 - Start
  1:47 - Inline math in an Org document
  1:59 - Export Org doc to PDF
  2:43 - Export Org doc to HTML
  3:07 - A display equation in an Org document
  3:55 - Executable code blocks in an Org document
  5:13 - Code block that generates graphics
  5:35 - Preview a graphic in Org
  5:55 - Tables in Org mode
  8:07 - Textual mark-up and hyperlinks

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WexRlr4c_6U</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WexRlr4c_6U">youtube</a><br><br>Why count words? These days, word counts aren't terribly important? Or are they?  Paying attention to your word count can help you focus your writing, write with clarity, and avoid wasting your reader's time.  And the bonus you get with counting words in Emacs is that you also get character counts.  Character counts can be just as important in writing for web as word counts.  So have fun counting words in Emacs buffers.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Show your Emacs shortcuts in colour when giving presentations</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/QfN0gNaxE2U</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtu.be/QfN0gNaxE2U">youtube</a><br><br>When you give presentations in which you use Emacs, other Emacs users would like to see the shortcuts you're using so that they can learn from you and your setup. The most famous mode for this is command-log-mode, however a more colourful, and in my opinion better, alternative exists in interaction-log-mode.

  This wee screeencast shows how it works and how you can keep the interaction-log-mode buffer open no matter what operations you or your plugins do in Emacs, including C-x 1.


  interaction-log-mode can be downloaded from: https://github.com/michael-heerdegen/interaction-log.el

  My Emacs configuration can be found here: https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/tree/master/emacs

  Often, people wonder about other things shown in the talk as well, like what theme and terminal is being used, thus:

  - The terminal multiplexer used is tmux, my conf is here: https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/tree/master/tmux
  - The terminal used is kitty, my conf is here: https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/tree/master/kitty
  - The desktop environment used i3, my conf is here:  https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/tree/master/i3


  Enjoy!</div>]]></description>

      <title>B-Trees in Emacs</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNCLCpSKvY</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNCLCpSKvY">youtube</a><br><br>A demo of a B-tree library for Emacs with which you can play around with B-trees. I found it useful while studying them for doing experiments, as online visualizers were too cumbersome for creating large trees, which I wanted to create to gain better intuition. Sorry for the bad sound!

You add a block of code into your Emacs config listing words and corresponding symbols.  Anytime you type one of the words, Emacs replaces with the symbol or emoji that you specify.

      <title>Tutorial Rápido: GDB no Emacs para debuggar assembly</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6aI8-ijE68</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6aI8-ijE68">youtube</a><br><br>Feito para eventual consulta futura. Aprendi a usar tentando resolver alguns códigos do livro "xchg rax,rax". Contém spoilers de um dos exercícios.


  A ideia é só realizar uma demonstração rápida da ferramenta. Gastei um tempinho me acostumando com o DDD (que é uma boa ferramenta, apesar de ser feia e ser mais orientada a uso de mouse), e passei um pouco de raiva tentando usar o KDBG (que é exclusivo de KDE e não consegui compilar). Tudo isso sem perceber que, possuindo o GDB, você pode usar praticamente qualquer coisa para te ajudar -- no meu caso, o Emacs, meu companheiro de guerra.


  É bem provável que os comandos aqui possuam bindings padrão para não ter que ficar digitando no console, mas eu fiz isso mesmo assim pra me acostumar a usar o GDB também.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Grazer Linuxtage 2021 - Emacs Org mode features you may not know</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Pf6ma8PtA</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Pf6ma8PtA">youtube</a><br><br>Emacs Org mode is huge and might overwhelm some people. Therefore, helpful features often gets lost in this large amount of documentation. In this talk, hand-selected tricks are demonstrated that may help the average Org mode user in her daily life.

  ---

  Bastien Guerry wrote [this article where he shows nice but rather unknown Org features](https://bzg.fr/en/some-emacs-org-mode-features-you-may-not-know.html/). His article inspired this talk which is about a selection of those features and much more here and there. It also covers some general Emacs features.

  For this talk, you should have a minimum level of experience with GNU/Emacs and Org mode. If not, it might provide some inspiration and motivation to start with GNU/Emacs. However the talk highlights only some features and tricks here and there, not providing a general overview.

  You can find the show-notes of the talk, links to external sources and the [colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)) on [this web page](https://karl-voit.at/2021/04/10/GLT21-emacs-org-features/).

  Please do send a short feedback [here](https://pretalx.linuxtage.at/glt21/talk/ZKEXNW/feedback/) after the talk.

      <title>Doom Emacs on a Phone!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEvZ82Ii9Ys</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEvZ82Ii9Ys">youtube</a><br><br>Doom Emacs on PostmarketOS.
  Important: Using VNC and recording the window using OBS has added extra lag and tearing, it's faster and there's no tearing when actually using the pinephone. Also the visual quality has been reduced.
  Although the pinephone isn't fast, I found it fast enough in most aspects to be usable, scrolling was a bit too slow though. It was very impressive to see the pinephone rotate near instantly, I'd bet it's faster than any android phone (it's faster than my snapdragon 855 Android).
  As you saw, everything in doom works like in the desktop version, sone things were cropped out though, Spacemacs does better in this aspect. If this was on a faster phone and with a custom keyboard layout, it would be hands-down the best mobile editor I've used.
  Configuration is definitely needed (I will post config soon), hopefully there will be more optimizations to make it faster and fix the choppy scrolling (pixel based scrolling).</div>]]></description>

      <title>Efficient Text Selection with Emacs Key Bindings - Emacs Essentials #3</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq5UOt63Mms</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq5UOt63Mms">youtube</a><br><br>In this video, we'll learn how to efficiently select text using Emacs' built-in key bindings!  We cover the "mark," the region, and the various ways we can use those to select text.  I'll also tell you about the "mark ring" and how it can be a very quick way to navigate back to previous locations you visited in the buffers you are editing!

  Check out the show notes here: https://systemcrafters.cc/emacs-essentials/efficient-selection-key-bindings/

  We cover the following topics:

  - 0:00 Intro
  - 0:36 What will we learn?
  - 1:17 What is the "mark"?
  - 2:55 Creating Regions
  - 11:57 Specialized Marking Commands
  - 17:24 Remember Your Place with the Mark Ring
  - 22:44 The Global Mark Ring
  - 25:51 What's next?

      <title>Let&apos;s write some Emacs Lisp - Github helper functions</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikt-Ha4CaY4</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikt-Ha4CaY4">youtube</a><br><br>I did an impromptu live coding session last week in which I did some Emacs Lisp refactoring and this is a bit of a continuation on that.


  Tonight, we'll continue creating some Github helper functions that help in my day-to-day coding. As a reminder, I'm a bit of a Lisp newbie having not written any Lisp (other than copy/paste) before a month ago or so. There are likely much better ways to do the things I'm doing here. If there are, please let me know in the comments!

  I've been working on my own literate Emacs config for a while now and am starting to dive into Emacs Lisp. I recently wrote a custom function for opening pages in github and I think it is ripe for refactoring. So let's try that! I'm definitely no Emacs expert though.

      <title>Installing Doom Emacs for the non-programmers (Windows &amp; Linux)</title>

  00:27 Demo of Doom Emacs (My Setup)
  00:50 Windows installation
  13:44 Linux installation

  I use this setup everyday, for task management, creating pptx files, docx files, book notes, writing my own books, blogging, and just about anything I can get away with doing it in Doom Emacs.

  This is for writers (i.e. non-programmers). If that's you, I'm sure you'll have questions. I'll try to answer then if you ask them.

  I included most of the problems I ran into while installing Emacs and Doom Emacs because I wanted you to see how I got around them.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6S-AKm5snc">youtube</a><br><br>In my never-ending quest to find the perfect way to create beautiful (yet minimal) websites, I had to try out Org Export in Emacs.  Since I tend to write everything in Org Mode these days, it would be amazing to simply be able to convert my Org docs into HTML, and maybe add a little CSS to spice things up.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7d2LmivyyM">youtube</a><br><br>In this video, we'll work on a practical example of writing Emacs Lisp to read and write contents of buffers!  We continue the work on our dotfiles management package, now called "dotcrafter.el", to add the ability to extract all tangled configuration paths from our Org Mode files and then write out those paths to the '.gitignore' file of the dotfiles repository.

  We cover the following topics:

  - 9:41 Changing the current buffer
  - 10:37 Changing the current buffer safely!
  - 13:55 Working with file buffers
  - 17:36 Example: Getting the buffers for our configuration Org files
  - 20:38 Loading a file into a buffer
  - 22:27 Example: Getting or creating the Org file buffer
  - 24:44 What's the point?
  - 28:21 Moving the point
  - 32:45 Preserving the point
  - 33:41 Examining buffer text
  - 36:26 The Thing (thing-at-point)
  - 39:45 Searching for text
  - 43:24 Example: Finding Org code block output paths

      <title>Hey Emacs, Don&apos;t Move My Windows! - Customizing display-buffer&apos;s behavior</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H2nU0rsUMY&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H2nU0rsUMY&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>In this video, I'll explain how Emacs' display-buffer function is used to determine which window (or frame!) gets used to display a buffer.  This is useful when you want to prevent Emacs from breaking your perfectly-organized window layouts!  I'll go through many of the built-in "display action" functions to explain how they work.  We'll conclude the video by changing our configuration to prevent popup windows from being created and to cause Org Mode and Help buffers to reuse windows containing other buffers for those modes!

  Keep an eye out for the next video where we will cover display-buffer-alist and custom display action functions!

  I've been off work for a month on paternity leave. I was working on the third floor of my house in my office, but to be closer to the family with a newborn I'm temporarily in my old office (soon to be nursery). Because of the temporary setup I haven't brought my main desktop down and I'm using my laptop.

  My emacs is out of date, so I need to get it set up how i have it on my main machine. I could copy the init.el and get on with stuff, but why not show what I'm doing?

  Thanks for watching :). If you liked this video consider liking and/or subscribing, it's most appreciated.

      <title>How to Cut Emacs Start Up Time in Half! - Emacs From Scratch #12</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/9i_9hse_Y08</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtu.be/9i_9hse_Y08">youtube</a><br><br>In this video, we'll learn how to use the features of 'use-package' to cause our Emacs packages to be loaded later so that Emacs starts up much faster than before!  We will also learn how to tweak the settings of Emacs' garbage collector so that it enables Emacs to do less work while loading up all of your packages.  By the end, we cut startup time of the Emacs From Scratch configuration in half!

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSZu4jwvaSs">youtube</a><br><br>In this video, we will learn a couple of useful techniques that will allow you to craft your own email processing workflow using Org Mode and mu4e:

  - Creating capture templates for reading and following up on messages later
  - Creating quick action bindings in mu4e views for invoking your capture templates
  - Compiling a set of links to queries so that it's easy to jump to messages from your Org file
  - Easily saving the link to the current header view to store it in your notes

      <title>&quot;Teaching an old Bovine Gnu Tricks: What&apos;s next for Emacs?&quot; - Jeffrey Walsh (LCA 2021 Online)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPwr8WeE8jU</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPwr8WeE8jU">youtube</a><br><br>Jeffrey Walsh

  https://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/48/

  In a rare positive of 2020, GNU/Emacs 27.1 was released with a heap of new features, bugfixes and performance improvements.
  This was almost immediately followed by the usual Navel-Gazing and bike-shedding discussion that gets emacs-devel in the news.

  Buried under the suggestions of new key-bindings, better user on-boarding and new languages that should replace lisp this time were discussions for features desperately needed to drag Emacs forward.

  One such feature is the porting of Emacs to the Wayland display Protocol using GTK3. While seemingly simple at first glance, the history of the Emacs display engine would prove to make this a much more difficult task.  

  In this talk I will cover the motivations and significant challenges of porting Emacs to use wayland, shed some skeletons from the code base, show the current state of the system before considering, what should be next for an editor that keeps on going.

  linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

      <title>Setting Up The Mu4e Email Client In Doom Emacs</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKp3hQP2VxQ</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKp3hQP2VxQ">youtube</a><br><br>Do you use Emacs?  Do you also use a desktop email client like Thunderbird or Geary?  There is no need to run those desktop email clients when Emacs has a great email client available.  That email client is called mu4e.

  NOTE:
  When I did the git clone of my dotfiles repo and copied over my .doom.d configs, my Doom configs didn't want to work properly initially, because my Doom configs expect the following packages to be installed.  So if you choose to use my Doom configs, make sure to install these!

I'll walk you through how you can use this feature to organize your windows into workspaces and also how to configure the feature to be more effective for your workflow.

      <title>Aliases in Org Roam Emacs Doom · Emacs Doomcasts 26</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83JoRBjTXog&list=PLhXZp00uXBk4np17N39WvB80zgxlZfVwj&index=25&pp=iAQB">youtube</a><br><br>In Org Roam we can set aliases for titles of our notes. This way we can refer to a single note using different names. This can be achieved using the `#+roam_alias` meta property.

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFH4GcnBxIg">youtube</a><br><br>Both options are great. I miss some of the features of Spacemacs, but the speed of doom is the best, and since Emacs is so extensible, I'll just tweak it how I want.

  Doom is better when it comes to speed and beginner-friendliness.

      <title>Doom Emacs And EXWM Are My New Window Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJjjflU67tE</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJjjflU67tE">youtube</a><br><br>A few months ago, I took a brief look at EXWM which is an Emacs plugin that allows you to use Emacs as your window manager.  And while I was impressed at how well EXWM can work as a window manager, I never really tried to live in it.  But I think I'm ready to give it a shot!

      <title>Emacs, Org-mode, R and LaTeX: Power tools in the archaeological toolbox</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-p5OhTejtw</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-p5OhTejtw">youtube</a><br><br>Writing a synthesis in archaeology is a complex challenge, especially when it requires large sets of data of a different kind to be collected and put in order. Using R to explore and comprehend information is just one part of this process. One usually needs a tool for code writing and interpreting at the very least and another tool for the textual side. Emacs and its Org-mode is an outlining combo that makes the whole process more consistent and more transparent in terms of scientific reproducibility. It allows every piece of research that makes up the publication to be written together in one text file. It can be compiled then and exported in one move to the format desired – most preferably LaTeX and PDF. The benefits of using R in such context and a software toolset have been examined in the writing of a comprehensive study of the Muslim necropolis on Kom el-Dikka. The study was based on a dataset drawn from analyses of skeletal remains of over 2,500 individuals excavated to date. The data was supplemented with archaeological investigation of almost 2,000 grave units to shed light on the changes that occurred in early Islamic Alexandria.

      <title>Org Roam Setup · Emacs Doomcasts 25</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH3ZH95zjKM&amp;list=PLhXZp00uXBk4np17N39WvB80zgxlZfVwj&amp;index=24&amp;pp=iAQB</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH3ZH95zjKM&list=PLhXZp00uXBk4np17N39WvB80zgxlZfVwj&index=24&pp=iAQB">youtube</a><br><br>Org Roam is a tool for organizing notes in Emacs built on top of Org Mode. It’s a replica of Roam Research, a web based tool that popularized this approach of organizing notes not in a hierarchical way, but as set of documents connected with links. Somehow similar to how the Web is organized. You write a note, then another and maybe you connected them with links if they are related. The key idea in Roam and in Org Roam is that for each note you can see on the side other notes that mention or reference the note you are currently viewing. By seeing the relations between your notes, you have more context about the information you are storing in them. It’s very simple, yet powerful. Finally, contrary to Roam Research, by using Emacs, you write notes as plain text. You can store them anywhere. And you are not locked-in to a particular vendor.

  * Capture a new note: `SPC n r c`
  * Add a link to a note: `SPC n r I`
  * See the backlinks: `SPC n r r`

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution.

If so, Emacs, Org Mode and Org Agenda lets you make todo lists, schedule tasks, manage projects and much more.

      <title>Doom Emacs For Noobs</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iab2z21cRqA</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iab2z21cRqA">youtube</a><br><br>Doom Emacs is my preferred text editor, and I have made several videos about it.  But some of those videos assumed that the viewer had some knowledge of Vim and/or Emacs.  So I decided to make this Doom Emacs introductory video for the complete noob!  This video covers how to install Doom Emacs, how to configure it, and some of the basic keybindings and commands.

      <title>Useful Tools Within Emacs For Writers</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT1-lLQVHsw</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT1-lLQVHsw">youtube</a><br><br>There seems to be a misconception about Emacs.  Many think that Emacs is only useful for programming.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If you do any kind of writing, you owe it to yourself to take a look at the tools that Emacs offers.

      <title>Want To Rewrite Your Configs In Org-Mode? It&apos;s Easy!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQe1ul51RM0&amp;list=PL5--8gKSku15uYCnmxWPO17Dq6hVabAB4&amp;index=44&amp;pp=iAQB</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQe1ul51RM0&list=PL5--8gKSku15uYCnmxWPO17Dq6hVabAB4&index=44&pp=iAQB">youtube</a><br><br>One of the killer features of Emacs is Org-Mode, which is a kind of markdown that makes creating outlines, tables, source code blocks, and tables of content really easy.  Often, when people discover Org-Mode, they start wanting to rewrite all of their configs as literate configs in Org.

  ERRATA:
  I mentioned in the video that this would work on any config file written in an actual programming language.  That 's not actually the case. Tangle will work on anything, so it doesn't have to be a programming language, since we are not really evaluating the code with this.  We are just writing what's in the SRC blocks to the file we specify.

  NOTE:
  I did all of this on a live stream earlier today but the stream had some buffering issues.  I thought this topic was too important not to go back and  re-record.  I have removed the earlier live stream.

      <title>Making My XMonad And Emacs Configs More Readable</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOmEBOY3544</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOmEBOY3544">youtube</a><br><br>I spent several hours this week cleaning up my configs for XMonad and Emacs.  Why?  Well, my XMonad config had grown to more 1,000 lines in length.  This made it a bit unwieldy and hard-to-read.  My Emacs config was also suffering from readability issues due to all the comments I was leaving in the config.  I found a solution to both of these problems.

      <title>Emacs Magit with Forge for merging Pull Requests · Emacs Doomcasts 21</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj4eRccsos8</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj4eRccsos8">youtube</a><br><br>Magit is an Emacs package that provides a convenient UI to the version control system Git. Magit aims to improve upon Git commands in order to make simple things faster and complicated things simple.

  Magit is already included and configured in Emacs Doom. You can use SPC g g to initiate the status page. Most Git commands are done from this status page. The status page provides comprehensive information about the current context changes. You can easily see files diffs and selectively stage parts of a file.

  In this episode we learn how to merge pull requests directly from Emacs using Magit and the Forge package.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.

  Transcript of chat:

  17:03:35  From Roger Pate : I haven't used Zoom before, been using Microsoft Teams since March
  17:05:09  From Roger Pate : Is xmonad a tiling manager?
  17:08:31  From kevin : Yeah xmonad is tiling, written and configured in haskell
  17:09:39  From adam : https://xmonad.org/ I remember that it was pretty complicated to figure out the config, but it makes you feel pretty cool lol!
  17:11:50  From Roger Pate : Indianapolis here
  17:16:11  From adam : https://github.com/anschwa/talks/blob/master/emacs_2020-06-18/readme.org
  17:16:38  From Roger Pate : always Vim so far :)
  17:17:17  From kevin : You can use evil-mode for emacs to get vim functionality
  17:17:45  From Rob Creel : I wouldn't complain about upping the font size a few steps. :)
  17:20:44  From Josh Martin : @Kevin that is very true
  17:58:57  From Rob Creel : I've got another meeting at 6, but thank you for having me!  After 5 years of half-hearted research and debate, I should probably decide soon whether to learn vim or emacs! :P  This presentation is a tally mark in the emacs column for sure.  I hope to make it back next month.  Cheers!
  18:17:06  From adam : https://indyhackers-slack.herokuapp.com/
  18:20:44  From Gerep  To  Josh Martin(privately) : I came in late sorry but I am curious about spacemacs. I am a vim user and a friend suggested it. I am not sure if that is a good way to start and try Emacs, what do you think?
  18:22:47  From Gerep : I came in late sorry but I am curious about spacemacs. I am a vim user and a friend suggested it. I am not sure if that is a good way to start and try Emacs, what do you think?
  18:23:13  From kevin : Gerep - that could work, also doom is a nice config
  18:23:31  From Gerep : so, spacemacs with doom?
  18:23:40  From kevin : Spacemacs or doom
  18:24:03  From Gerep : Ah! got it, thanks.
  18:24:05  From kevin : They are both pretty similar from what I’ve seen
  18:24:32  From kevin : Or you could just use the evil-mode package in emacs, that’s what I do
  18:29:37  From Roger Pate : thank you!</div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg61ocfxk3c">youtube</a><br><br>I'm assuming that you read a bit during the day. Books. Webpages. And Magazines. And you might watch videos, and attend online or in person classes. And maybe other forms of content. And if you do, it's worth taking notes. But how do you connect the thoughts and be able to take action on what you learn. In this video I introduce you to a couple tools that I think can make an enormous difference in your lives. If you end up using either one, let me know.

      <title>Learning from Emacs: buffers, helm, terminal</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/GJ4i10U_zzg</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtu.be/GJ4i10U_zzg">youtube</a><br><br>- Emacs can be daunting - helm mode can beat that.
  - Still, why emacs?
  --A. org-mode, may be a lisp, may be for the next 40 years; or ...

  A minimal set of packages to conquer emacs: https://github.com/digikar99/emacs-noob. For something more full-fledged, and especially if you are into Vim, there are Spacemacs and Doom-emacs. My complaint: they customize emacs too much; I find emacs to be something that grows along with the user.

  PS: There are still many many things left out of the video: magit,  hideshow, imenu-list, company autocompletion framework, lsp and eglot (say, what?), evil mode, interactive REPLs, indent-by-mode. I'm also aware that at one place in the video, I have used C-x C-f instesd of C-x C-s.

  Can Emacs replace a full IDE, like Pycharm, or Jetbrains, or Android Studio? If you actually use the IDE features, and work on 1000+ line projects, then, probably not.</div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtu.be/r-BHx7VNX5s">youtube</a><br><br>Post Editing Notes:

  1. `spc spc` and then `workon` to find the command for switching virtualenvs. It's not clear in the video. Apologies for that.

  2. the packages I install are flake8 isort yapf python-language-server

  In this video I cover the absolute minimum setup for doing Python development in Spacemacs.

  - I start off with a discussion of Python virtualenvs and how to get them set up correctly for Spacemacs.

  - Then a discussion of code completion.

  - Afterwards I show how to explore and fix issues found by a linter (flake8)

  - And then go over how to run scripts from inside emacs.

  - Finally I demonstrate a language server based completion backend.

I go over finding folders, moving between files in a project, fuzzy searching for code, going to definition of symbol, and much more.

  At 14:10 there is a small update about the future of the channel, why this video was so late, why the quality of this video is lower than prior videos, and why there's very faint background cry of a baby around the 7 minute mark.

      <title>Getting Started With Doom Emacs</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/dr_iBj91eeI</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtu.be/dr_iBj91eeI">youtube</a><br><br>So I'm glad I stuck with playing with standard GNU Emacs for a few weeks.  I think it was beneficial to learn the default keybindings and see how Emacs can be built from the ground up.  But I need to move back to using the Vim keybindings to save my sanity.  So I'm checking out a distribution of Emacs called Doom Emacs.  It uses the Vim bindings and includes a nice, sensible configuration that is easy to modify.

      <title>Emacs Magit with Forge for Issuing Pull Requests - Emacs Doomcasts 20</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFuf3hExF5w&list=PLhXZp00uXBk4np17N39WvB80zgxlZfVwj&index=20&pp=iAQB">youtube</a><br><br>Magit is an Emacs package that provides a convenient UI to the version control system Git. Magit aims to improve upon Git commands in order to make simple things faster and complicated things simple.

  Magit is already included and configured in Emacs Doom. You can use SPC g g to initiate the status page. Most Git commands are done from this status page. The status page provides comprehensive information about the current context changes. You can easily see files diffs and selectively stage parts of a file.

  In this episode we learn how to combine Magit with the Forge package in order to be able to issue pull requests directly from Emacs. Using the create pull requests command we specify one of our branches as the base for this pull request. Once submitted, the pull request appears on GitHub.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.

      <title>Literate Programming with Emacs Org-mode</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9i2wcCfzU&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9i2wcCfzU&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Literate Programming is about creating narratives. Programs
  are part of the narrative. Invented by Donald Knuth in the
  1970's, literate programming inverts the idea of code and
  comments. Rather than comments supporting code, we now have
  code supporting a narrative.


  Key learnings:
  1. Introduction to emacs Org-mode
  2. How to do multi-language literate programming using Org-mode

  No prior knowledge of Emacs is necessary. However, if you
  come to the talk with a laptop, please make sure Emacs and
  Org-mode are installed on it.

      <title>Lightning talk: Commanding Emacs from Coq</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/UebPmYcI13M</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtu.be/UebPmYcI13M">youtube</a><br><br>Interactive theorem provers like Coq, Agda and Idris allow programmers to ask questions about incomplete programs (or proofs) to Emacs, and get meaningful answers based on types of the missing parts. This turns programming into a conversation between programmers and their compilers, where Emacs acts as an intermediary. However, programmers are limited in the kinds of questions they can ask. Recent work on extensible editor actions leverages metaprogramming techniques to specify how the compiler should answer custom questions, but that requires writing code in Emacs Lisp to glue the compiler and the editor interface because metaprograms can only command the compiler and not the editor itself.

  In this talk, I will describe editor metaprogramming, a novel idea of writing metaprograms that command the editor. I define a monadic embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) for editor commands in Coq, which enables composing these commands in meaningful ways, with the full power of Coq! I will write an interpreter for this eDSL in Emacs Lisp, and make Emacs and Coq processes communicate back and forth. Coq computations will be sent back to Coq, and effectful editor actions such as deleting a character and moving the cursor will be executed in Emacs Lisp.

      <title>Oral History of James Gosling, part 1 of 2</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ6XHroNewc&amp;t=10377</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ6XHroNewc&t=10377">youtube</a><br><br>Interviewed by Hansen Hsu and Marc Weber on 2019-03-15 in Mountain View, CA X8971.2019
  © Computer History Museum

  James Gosling is known as the father of the Java programming language. Growing up and attending college in Calgary, Alberta, Gosling began his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University in 1977, finishing in 1983. While at CMU, Gosling developed the first Unix version of Emacs, learned about byte codes while porting PERQ software to VAX, and developed the Andrew window system. After a brief stint at IBM working on a RISC computer, Gosling joined Sun in 1984, and created the NeWS window system. After NeWS lost to X Windows in the marketplace, a group including Gosling formed the Green project at the end of 1990 to explore consumer technologies, producing the Star7, a multimedia remote control. It was for Star7 that Gosling first created the Oak language, later renamed Java. After a brief spin-out from Sun as the company FirstPerson and an unsuccessful foray into interactive cable TV, Gosling’s team repurposed Java for the Web in 1994, which enabled dynamic and interactive web pages at a time when most were static. Sun partnered with Netscape to include Java with the Navigator browser in 1995. Sun’s goal was for Java to become a network-centric, platform-independent platform that would free computers from proprietary systems like Microsoft. While Java is less popular than other languages on PCs and web browsers, it has become the dominant language in enterprise computing, and a major player in mobile and embedded computing.

      <title>Emacs Magit - The Git Commit Flow in More Detail - Emacs Doom 19</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXgGtyjXPiw&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXgGtyjXPiw&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Magit is an Emacs package that provides a convenient UI to the version control system Git. Magit aims to improve upon Git commands in order to make simple things faster and complicated things simple.

  Magit is already included and configured in Emacs Doom. You can use SPC g g to initiate the status page. Most Git commands are done from this status page. The status page provides comprehensive information about the current context changes. You can easily see files diffs and selectively stage parts of a file.

  In this episode we are reviewing the the committing flow in Git using Magit. It goes from selecting changes through tagging particular commits up to pushing to remote repositories. This showcase some additional Magit's features compared to the flow discussed in the previous episode.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.

  Hi! I find programming to be a form of caaaaalming relaaaaxation, and watching people code does the same thing for me. This is my slow, gentle livestream where I mess around with interesting new technologies, chat about geek culture,  the EFF (where I work) and other intriguing, but unhectic, topics. You can join me in chat at https://twitch.tv/codetherapy or IRC at irc.oftc.net #codetherapy (see http://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=codetherapy )</div>]]></description>

      <title>Emacs Org Mode - Using Checkboxes - Emacs Doom 17</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYgsS8Be1ZY&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYgsS8Be1ZY&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Every item in a plain list can be converted into a checkbox, which makes it a simple task. Checkboxes in Org Mode start with square brackets. They are used to split a task into a number of simple steps, or to create a checklist.

  Checkboxes can be nested. In that case, the parent checkbox tracks the progress of its children. Additionally, there are markers to display the count, either as a number or as a percentage. These are called cookies in Org Mode. Those cookies must be attached to the parent element, either headline or another checkbox.

  Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.

  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJq__bBi0nI&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJq__bBi0nI&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>In Org Mode, tags can be used to correlate or group different tasks (or headlines) together, based on a context. Tags can be attached to any headline (not only task headlines) and they are displayed between colons.

  In Emacs Doom, use `SPC m q` to assign a tag to the given headline. In Org Mode, headlines inherit tags from their parent headlines. They are also two ways of search for headlines by using tags. You can use org-agenda's tags search triggered by the `SPC o a m` which displays the results in a separate buffer; or, you can generate a sparse tree with the given tag by using `org-sparse-tree` or `org-tags-sparse-tree` functions.

  Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.

      <title>Emacs Doom E15: Org Mode, Priorities for Tasks</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF4EgQqa3Q&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF4EgQqa3Q&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Org Mode allows to set priorities for tasks headlines. By default the priority marker goes from A (the highest priority), through B (the medium priority) to C (the lowest priority). In Org Mode, the priority marker is called the priority cookie. Priorities can be attached to any headline, this doesn't have to be a task.

  A task/todo headline without the priority is equal to a headline with the B priority. Priorities are useful only in the agenda context. The highest priority tasks are displayed first either in the agenda view or in the agenda tasks.

  You can change the priority cookie color using the `org-priority-faces` variable. It is a list of priorities from the highest to the lowest with the ASCII code and corresponding color. There is also an external package called `org-fancy-priorites` which allows to change the look of the priority cookie.

  Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.

  ═════════

    company is an alternative auto completion framework. It is more active
    than [auto-complete] and there are many newer packages that prefer or
    only support company.

    Also it is what [jweigly], [purcell] and [bbatsov] use, so it must be
    good.
    ┌────
    │ (use-package company
    │   :hook (emacs-lisp-mode)
    │   :config (global-company-mode t)
    │   (setq company-tooltip-align-annotations t)
    │   ;; Use builtin faces instead of ugly ones set by company
    │   (custom-set-faces
    │    '(company-preview
    │      ((t (:foreground "darkgray" :underline t))))
    │    '(company-preview-common

      <title>Emacs Doom E14: Org Mode, Getting Organized with Tasks</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxygfqLrFSU&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxygfqLrFSU&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Org Mode is incredibly versatile. It not only allows to create and store notes, but it also provides a comprehensive task management functionalities.

  With Org Mode you have flexibilty how you manage yours tasks. Those tasks can be included in your notes or spread across many files. Each file can be dedicated to a specific project or area of activity.

  By default, tasks in Org Mode come with two statuses TODO for open tasks and DONE for closed tasks. It is easy, however, to define your own task statuses using the org-todo-keywords variable.

  Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.

  Org Mode headlines are created with the asterisk sign.

      <title>Emacs Doom E13: Org Mode, Code Snippets 101</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT1bcq_HIkE&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT1bcq_HIkE&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.

  Org Mode allows to include code snippets. There are special #+BEGIN_SRC and #+END_SRC markers for that. Out of the box Org Mode supports many popular languages. For the lesser known programming languages there is a plethora of plugins to make it work. The snippets are automatically highlighted. It is also possible to conveniently edit them in a separate buffer.

  This feature is similar to other editors, especially the ones supporting Markdown. What sets Org Mode and Emacs apart is that the code snippets can be executed right inside an Org document. Not only that, the block of texts outside of the snippets can provide the input data and the result of each snippet can be chained.

  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.

  Org Mode headlines are created with the asterisk sign.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5s1ScTx8Zk">youtube</a><br><br>In this presentation from July 17 2019, Siddhartha Kasivajhula takes us through Symex Mode, which is a way to edit Lisp code in a Vim-like way, as an alternative to packages like paredit and lispy. Symex mode is based on a DSL that can express arbitrary tree navigations, the most common and useful of which are accessible via a modal interface implemented using the excellent Hydra package.

      <title>Emacs Doom E12: Org Mode - Linking to words &amp; Bookmarks</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU1EV8gzZb8&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU1EV8gzZb8&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Org Mode is considered to be the Emacs killer application. It is a personal knowledge management and outlining tools for Emacs.

  Today, let's dive into the Emacs configuration by adjusting some Org Mode related settings. In order to link to particular words, there is a special variable `org-link-search-must-match-exact-headline`, when set to `nil` you will be able to target words using links, otherwise only links to headlines are possible. Additionally, you can quickly store or bookmark locations for any headline using `SPC n l`. Later, when creating a link, it's just a matter of selecting a particular bookmark from the selection list.

  Org documents can be connected using links. There are two types of links in Org Mode: internal and external links. Internal links target headlines in a particular document while external links can not only link between Org documents and files, but also target resources on the web. This can as simple as an HTTP link, but there are different link types as well. Org documents can references Emacs Lisp scripts, Shell commands, Usenet groups and many, many more.

  Org Mode documents are textual files. There is no proprietary format. Those files can be easily checked into a Git repository so that you can follow how they evolve over time.

  Org Mode headlines are created with the asterisk sign.

  plugin is adapted to the Evil mode. It allows to make selections and edit them
  interactively at once. It achieves that by integrating with the iedit-mode.

  The evil-multiedit plugin comes with sensible defaults. If you are using Emacs
  Doom, it is already installed and configured. You can use it right away.

  There are many options to easily fine-tune the evil-multiedit plugin. You can

      <title>Emacs Doom E07: Moving around the screen with Avy</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zar4GsOBU0g&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zar4GsOBU0g&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Avy is an Emacs package for jumping to visible text using a char-based decision tree. It is similar to ace-jump-mode and vim-easymotion.

  Avy allows to use the search mechanic to efficiently move to another place within the visible area. In other words, you choose the place that you want the cursor to be and with a search for a word followed by a label selection, you quickly jump there. Avy is one of the most powerful packages in Emacs that provide such text-jumping functionality.

  Once you get used to Avy, it is almost as if you can move the cursor using your eyes, just by looking where you want it to be placed.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdLCuJcS2Aw&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>In this video I describe the installation, configuration, and usage of my primary text editor: Spacemacs (http://spacemacs.org/). This editor is a kit for the venerable Emacs text editor and is very suitable for programming, especially when dealing with large complex code bases.

  Disclaimer: This tutorial assumes you know the basics of navigating code in Vim. If you do not, consider watching a video on the subject (this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxET5r3Xc3g is pretty good).

  Note: it was pointed out to me that I forgot to go over how to create a new file. You can do it vim style ( :e filepath ) or if you try to visit a non existing file in the SPC f f menu it'll create a new file for you.

      <title>Emacs Org-mode: Organizing a Scientist&apos;s Life and Work by Prof. Carsten Dominik</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgyRdnjRI4o</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgyRdnjRI4o">youtube</a><br><br>A step-by-step talk from Dr. Carsten Dominik on how to use Org-mode to organize one's life as a scientist.

  Org-mode combines many organizational tasks into one application including an expandable outliner, a to-do system, note taking, code documentation and execution, and document creation.  This effectively encompasses the functionality of workflowy, OneNote/Evernote,  jupyter/ipython notebooks, and your favorite to-do app all in one place.

  If you are interesting in trying org-mode you can get installation instructions here: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html#orgb836ac0

  Or visit the main page here: https://orgmode.org

  Note: Org-mode is an application or 'mode' in Emacs. I personally recommend using Spacemacs to run Org-mode as it is more user friendly than stock emacs.  To avoid confusion, select emacs mode when setting up spacemacs.

  To start off the new series, I thought it would be a good idea to go on a quest to find the best text editor to use for our web design. I don’t know why I thought that was a good idea, but I did. In this video we’re messing around with Emacs, a fancy little gadget that resides within your Terminal. I’m not an expert on the tool, but I know we can use it to write HTML & CSS, so that’s what we’re going to do today.

  Unfortunately the speaker's microphone was off so we had to use audio from two separate sources in the audio. This means the audio quality is not great, and also there is an 18 minute gap in the middle.

    By default Emacs tries to guess the Paragraph direction for bidi-text.

That is: write the tests FIRST, then implement the actual code. Refactor. Then do the same thing all over again.

  The screencast also shows that Emacs is now, thanks to lsp-mode, dap-mode, yasnippets and many others, an excellent Java editor. My configuration can be found here: https://github.com/skybert/my-little-friends/tree/master/emacs

  Old hacker, new to Emacs, and starting to Grok. Got this tplink "smart plug" piece of insecure kit for my wife to run the coffee maker from an app. Well the app is huge and I don't want it on my phone. A quick google search and I can control it from a terminal. But who wants to leave emacs?

  I've never written something like this before, and it's only my second thing to write in elisp, so I didn't really expect to hack it out in an hour before work by only reverse engineering the yahoo weather mode line widget and built in help commands... Because it actually took 90 minutes...

  Title: Org-mode and other useful things in Emacs

  Abstract:
  "Org-mode" is a built-in feature in the Emacs text editor. It has been the bedrock of the way I organize my workflow for the last 5 years. In my talk, I will be showcasing:
  - Org-mode's tree structure for information storage and access
  - its spreadsheet capability
  - some basic Lisp for in-buffer computations
  - integration with Jupyter notebooks
  and much more!

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK3fij-D1G8&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>This is a re-recording of a talk I held about Org-mode, literate programming and Emacs at Zenuity (https://www.zenuity.com/). The aim was to provide a live presentation which showcases some of the many possibilities that Org-mode offers. Giving the viewer more an overall picture but also offer some deeper dives of Emacs and elisp features.

  I would also like to give a lot of credit to Henrik Lissner's Doom https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs. The configuration is nothing but awesome and I have learned a lot from him during my time as an Emacs user.

  My additional private customizations can be found at https://github.com/niklascarlsson/doom-private. And if you are interested in the content of the video it's available at https://github.com/niklascarlsson/presentations/tree/master/literate_programming.

  The EmacsConf (or Summit) proposal on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/9kb94m/emacs_summit_can_we_make_it_happen/
  5:00 George Jones talked about how Xah Lee's fly-keys and the Kinesis Advantage helped him https://github.com/xahlee/xah-fly-keys
  9:45 Howard Abrams explains how he uses eww (Emacs Web Wowser) as his "first" (not "primary") browser with eww-readable
  19:25 Logan on evil-mode
  33:13 George comes back on for more fly-keys and ergonomic stuff (with assist from Xah Lee, who is present)
  45:11 Jeff Trull on C++ IDE features (and in particular lsp-mode)
  54:32 general discussion on Python support
  59:40 and now Javascript. Logan describes his setup.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOZ2KZpl4OM">youtube</a><br><br>The second freenode #live took place at We The Curious (formerly At-Bristol Science Centre) in Bristol, UK on Saturday 3rd and Sunday 4th November 2018.

  Sachin works at Red Hat and is passionate about Free and Open source software. He is avid GNU Emacs user and likes to talk and write about open source, GNU/Linux, Git, and Python. He works on OpenStack & ManageIQ. He also like to explore Swift Object Storage in spare time. He can be reached on IRC as psachin@{Freenode, OFTC, gnome}. Sachin blogs at http://psachin.github.io

  GNU Emacs for all
  Having using GNU Emacs for more that 6 years now and doing Python development for equal amount of time I’d like to share my experience with this great GNU software which has been for 30 years. I’d like to go through how I use Emacs for almost all my tasks like note taking, agenda, LaTeX, reveal.js presentations, IDE, and IRC. In this talk I’ll demonstrate how Emacs can be configured to do all such thing without a need to a dedicated application for each specific task. I’ll also talk about how to maintain Emacs configurations using org-mode and literate programming.</div>]]></description>

      <title>The Emacs Ipython Notebook- John Miller (Honeywell UOP)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB9vFu9Za8w</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB9vFu9Za8w">youtube</a><br><br>John Miller offers an overview of the Emacs IPython Notebook (EIN), a full-featured client for the Jupyter Notebook in Emacs, and shares a brief history of its development. John covers the features of EIN that make it uniquely Emacs—starting and automatically logging into a Jupyter server from inside Emacs, connecting Python buffers to a running kernel, allowing for interactive evaluation, org-mode Babel support, Emacs debugger integration, and company-mode and Jedi auto-complete integration. John then explains how he uses EIN in his own work, with a simple case study of troubleshooting activity decline of highly chlorided alumina catalyst in a pentane isomerization chemical process.

      <title>Virtualized Emacs as an IDE</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDrG-_kapaQ&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDrG-_kapaQ&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Adrien Brochard demonstrates a different way to Emacs: combining Emacs and Linux as a virtualized IDE to work on any machine. It includes a collection of bash script that automates the build of a dev environment and a set of literate Emacs config files which takes care of replicating packages and settings.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCMh7srOqvw&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Getting started with Doom, an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer.

  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK7L2Ulagnw&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Org-mode, a mode within the Emacs text editor, provides a vast array of features that are useful for anyone working in technical fields. In addition to offering tools for indirect "work" (e.g. emails, todos, time tracking, contacts, journasls/logs, etc.), Org-mode presents a nice environment for reproducible research, literate programming, and document creation. This talk will provide an overview of said features, focusing briefly on tools for indirect work with a more dedicated look/demo at how Org-mode can be used for data analysis (with R as the primary language), interspersing prose and executable code, and the ability to export documents in multiple formats (pdf, html, md, etc.).

  Upcoming Tech Chats: https://sa2c.swansea.ac.uk/techchat/

  ======================================

  Abstract: At this TechChat, we'll take a look at spacemacs, a popular new configuration for the emacs editor. This provides, amongst other things, a near-identical replication of vim within emacs. Seasoned vim users can access unparalleled configurability and extendability of emacs, without the need to learn new keybindings for editing. The configuration is designed to make emacs easily discoverable and make common configurations simple. Vanilla emacs users can have the convenience of simple modular configuration, whilst taking advantage of a powerful modular configuration and switching between vim and emacs style with a single keystroke.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Play Emacs like an instrument</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/gfZDwYeBlO4</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://youtu.be/gfZDwYeBlO4">youtube</a><br><br>My (literate) Emacs config is here: https://github.com/munen/emacs.d/

  Lean back and relax while enjoying a deep dive into the wonderful world of the Emacs editor. Emacs renaissance came with the advent of Clojure and undoubtedly is the most popular editor among Clojurians today. Of course there is a lot more you can do with Emacs, but much like playing an instrument, great skill only comes with practice.

  You neither need to be an Emacs user nor a Clojure programmer and neither do you need to contemplate about becoming one either to enjoy this talk. Much like you don't become a professional musician by attending a concert, but it might very well be inspiring.

  This talk was recorded at the Clojure Meetup in Zurich, Switzerland (organised by 200ok.ch).

  Please find the slides here: http://200ok.ch/posts/2018-04-27_Play_Emacs_like_an_Instrument.html

      <title>OrgMode - A third approach to goal setting &amp; tracking</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odOKnNDKSIs&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odOKnNDKSIs&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>This one is inspired by a comment from Hugo on the previous video about goal setting and tracking. Its a very smart approach that uses hierarchical tags for goals and the actions you need to do to achieve that goal.

  I just added a blog article about this:

      <title>Practical Chicken Scheme with Emacs: hello-world webserver</title>

This screencast shows how you can go about this, with many of the practicalities of using a REPL in Emacs, Chicken Scheme threads and a webserver API.

  The main focus is on workflow: The interpreter is started, and you build up your program incrementally as it's running. When you're done, you save, compile and "deploy".

  Content:
  - REPL basics: send code surrounding the cursor to an interpreter
  - Spawning and terminating srfi-18 threads interactively
  - Webserver API: spiffy
  - Compiling your result

  Ivy, Counsel, and Swiper are great if you can figure out how to use them! Luckily they are all pretty simple. In fact, you can just... install them and copy/paste some stuff and be on your way! I wanted to understand these emacs packages though, and that's a little more challenging.

  Ivy is a package that helps you search. It helps you do things in M-x, or find file, and Dired, etc... Anything where you look for something in Emacs, Ivy can come to the rescue and help you type less.

  For example. Let's say I want to look through some Melpa packages. No longer do I have to type package-list-packages.  Instead, I can just type "pa li packa"  and Ivy will find all the results that match the search terms. Using spaces, you can target certain parts of what you're looking for. It just helps you type less.

  Ivy doesn't rely on anything, but Swiper will automatically pull in Ivy when it's installed, because Swiper needs Ivy. Swiper does the same thing as Ivy, but replaces isearch, so you can use ivy features when searching through text.

  Counsel gives you extra functions that aren't normally available. For example: You can open a buffer or file in a new window.

  These packages integrate with a LOT of other emacs packages, so it's really</div>]]></description>

      <title>Emacs Super Fast Frame/Window Switching with FrameMove &amp; WindMove</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3th2jyv35c</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3th2jyv35c">youtube</a><br><br>https://truthseekers.io/lessons/an-introduction-to-emacs-everything-you-need-to-know-to-get-started/

  0:20 - Windmove with Arrows
  1:51 - FrameMove with Arrows
  3:55 - Hook FrameMove & WindMove together
  6:00 - Move with VIM bindings!!



  In this video you'll learn how to quickly switch between Windows and Frames using the packages "FrameMove" and "WindMove".

  The problem with the default Emacs configuration is that switching between frames and windows is slow and inefficient.

  Switching to a new Emacs Frame by default uses the command C-x 5 0,  and switching between windows is C-x o, and when you use C-x o you have to go through a loop.

  By using Windmove and framemove you can setup intuitive and efficient keybindings to quickly move between windows and frames.

  Most people setup windmove and framemove to cycle between windows using the arrow keys along with a modifier key like "Shift". This is a significant improvement upon the default because you can switch between emacs windows & frames using the arrow keys.

  Instead of being limited to forward and backward, you can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT, which can dramatically improve your speed.

  Unfortunately, the arrow keys are too far away. Any good programmer will keep his or her hands on the keyboard as much as possible, and not waste their time reaching for the arrow keys unless necessary.

  Luckily, there's a simple improvement to allow you to switch between Emacs windows and frames even quicker.  By editing your .emacs configuration, you can adjust the windmove and framemove shortcuts to be bound to the keys "H", "J", "K", and "L".

  If you look closely, you'll notice those keys are right under your fingers when you're typing, so it's much easier and faster to move between frames and windows!</div>]]></description>

      <title>How to grab &quot;bootstrap glyphicon list&quot; using mozilla/firefox and emacs/multiple-cursors</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKmuH65hHg</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKmuH65hHg">youtube</a><br><br>How to grab "bootstrap glyphicon list" using mozilla/firefox and emacs/multiple-cursors:

  1. Copy outer html from inspect element.
  2. Yank it into emacs/web-mode buffer. (another mode is fine)
  3. c-x h to select all text in buffer.
  4. m-x mc/mark-all-in-region-regexp &lt;enter&gt;.
  5. Mark regexp in region: "glyphicon glyphicon-[a-z-]*" &lt;enter&gt;.
  6. c-w to cut all marked text. (it's a little lack on my computer)
  7. Waiting until done.
  8. c-g c-g to deactivate multiple-cursors.
  9. c-x h del to clear the buffer.
  10. c-x r y to yank the list.

  Notes:
  c-x = &lt;ctrl&gt;-x
  m-x = &lt;alt&gt;-x
  c-w = &lt;ctrl&gt;-w
  c-g = &lt;ctrl&gt;-g

      <title>Run Scheme on Emacs - Ubuntu</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5jxMRlXvDw</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5jxMRlXvDw">youtube</a><br><br>Here are the instructions to install Racket, and configure Emacs to run Scheme. Just follow steps 1-8 :
  1.) Copy and paste the text (at the BOTTOM of this page) in your .emacs file
  (note: you can access .emacs by using keyboard macros C-x C-f (this means ctrl+x ctrl +f) then type ~/.emacs in mini-buffer)
  2.) On the last line, make sure it says "mzscheme" instead of "scm"
  3.) Save file
  4.) Download Racket
      - just type "sudo apt-get install racket" in the command prompt
  5.) Create your first scheme program and save it
  6.) Run Scheme process (this is done in emacs text editor)
        - "M-x run-scheme"
  7.) You are now using racket interpreter, load your scheme program by typing:
        -  "load [your_program_name.scm]" (note: brackets are not required)
  8.) Now you're ready to go

  sources:
  http://racket-lang.org/


  ======== COPY/PASTE EVERYTHING BELOW INTO YOUR EMACS CONFIG FILE =========

  ;;; Always do syntax highlighting
  (global-font-lock-mode 1)

  ;;; Also highlight parens
  (setq show-paren-delay 0 show-paren-style 'parenthesis) (show-paren-mode 1)

  ;;; This is the binary name of my scheme implementation
  (setq scheme-program-name "mzscheme")

  Emacs ist weit mehr als ein Editor, in seinem Ökosystem haben sich mittlerweile zahlreiche nützliche Werkzeuge etabliert, wovon das bekannteste vermutlich der org-mode ist. org-mode hilft bei der Organisation der täglichen Notizen und Todos, und sind die Keybindings einmal im Muskelgedächtnis verankert geschieht dies rasend schnell.

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efPPh2jUrkg">youtube</a><br><br>There is quite a discussion on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/54pxp1/emacs_is_hurting_clojure/) due to a post about Emacs hurting Clojure. The idea being that it is too difficult to get started with both Emacs and Clojure. So, I explore what needs to be done to start from absolute zero to a productive Clojure environment.

  Hint: it needs some work from the community. I will turn this video into a blog post as well with a getting started guide.</div>]]></description>

  Wer bislang nur bunte, langsame IDEs verwendet hat, kann bei uns lernen was man mit Meta-X alles machen kann.  Wir geben eine schmerzlose Einführung in emacs, in der _nicht_ (nur) die super-coolsten Features gezeigt werden, sondern die in täglicher Arbeit am häufigsten verwendeten Tastenkombinationen  ervorgehoben und besprochen werden.  Wer vim verwendet möge bitte einen eigenen Vortrag halten.

  To grab the source code, hop over to https://github.com/howardabrams/dot-files/blob/master/emacs-eshell.org#shell-there

  I promised that I would give the source to the function that populates the map of hosts and their IP address. Keep in mind, you could just hard-code those values if you wish (as it is just a hash-table). However, this is what I wrote to call to an OpenStack system to populate that hashmap, so to see that, check out this gist: https://gist.github.com/howardabrams/e7237b6bbd9e84bcc353bde13213576a</div>]]></description>

  "Org mode is an outliner, markup language, task manager, calendar, contact manager, and who-knows-what-else. I use it to write documents and presentations, manage my todo list, and I even write my Emacs configuration in it.

  In other words, Org is taking over my life.

  I’ll be introducing some of the functionality of Org, demonstrating what it can do, and showing how you, too, can become pleasantly obsessed with a wacky, overgrown outlining tool."

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtliRYQd0j4</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtliRYQd0j4">youtube</a><br><br>magit is a fantastic git frontend that goes through life as an Emacs package.

  In this screencast, I show you how to rewrite git history by rewording commit messages, reordering and squashing commits together, and finally by breaking open larger commits into smaller ones, all with Emacs and magit.

  Erratum: At one point I call the at-sign an ampersand. I'm really sorry about that.

  You should definitely also checkout Howard Abrams's magit demonstration, it's super well done: https://youtu.be/vQO7F2Q9DwA

  Video was captured using the built-in Quicktime screen recording (NOT recommended, resolution of capture region can't be numerically configured) on the Mac. Keystrokes are shown on the screen by the open source keycastr. Video was downsampled and transcoded to MKV using handbrake on Linux.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Python + Org-mode for fluent output generation of scientific research</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvse62CR-w0&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvse62CR-w0&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Generating outputs (plots, tables, and texts) is an essential part of scientific research. Usually they are generated with scripts (either .py or.ipynb`), and a natural way of maintaining these scripts is using either a long script file or multiple short files.

  When one has to update these outputs, the usual workflow is: 1) find the file(s) and code block(s) inside the file that contains the code for output generation, 2) re-learn what you did so you can edit the code, and 3) run the code to generate new outputs.

  Each of these steps has a cognitive overhead (non-fluency), which hampers your productivity, especially if it has been a while since you looked at them. Using IPython Notebook facilitates some of the procedures but it does not solve everything.

  In this talk, I introduce org-mode and some of its functionalities for all three steps. org-mode is ideal for managing these tasks because it can minimize the non-fluency. It has a convenient and flexible markup syntax for hierarchical documents. It uses tree-like headlines, which make it very easy to organize code and text. It provides a convenient way to collapse or expand headline blocks and navigate through them. In addition, one can execute a code block or export the results (or the source code itself) conveniently inside org-mode. Theoretically, one can have the entire contents and code for a paper and a presentation inside one org file. I show examples of how one can leverage these functionalities to maintain outputs.</div>]]></description>

That's right, Emacs. Aaron decided it was time to see how things looked on the other side and will share what he found, what he missed from Vim, and maybe even a few things we can bring back to Vim from Emacs.

      <title>Searching the Web with engine-mode</title>

That's really easy in Emacs Lisp--my documentation is built into my editor--but in most other languages I'm not so lucky.

  I wrote engine-mode to help fix this problem. It's a simple minor mode that lets me define arbitrary search engines and send snippets of text to them from within Emacs. Now I don't have to copy and paste text between my browser and editor! So fancy.

  We'll be talking about how to get started with engine-mode (it's easy!) and then digging into the implementation and discussing the process of committing a package to MELPA.

He also highlights useful packages for managing buffers of version-controlled files (ibuffer-vc), working with lines if the region isn't active (whole-line-or-region), or maximizing certain buffers (full-frame).

      <title>Org-mode for Reproducible Research</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGnt_PWoM5Y&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGnt_PWoM5Y&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>The amazing Emacs org-mode has myriad uses and features including outlining, note-taking, table management, and publishing to HTML and LaTeX. It’s also a fabulous tool to help make your research reproducible. From Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research):
  In 2012, a survey done for Nature found that 47 out of 53 medical research papers on the subject of cancer were irreproducible (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html)… Researchers explained in a 2006 study that, of 249 data sets from American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 73% of contacted authors did not respond with their data (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17032082) over a 6-month period.

  Org-mode allows authors to include their datasets and all programs that were run to generate figures and text. Included files can be used to facilitate version control. While there are limits to this approach—including data generation and software versioning—it represents a big advance in reproducibility and one which has not yet been widely adopted.

      <title>The Editor of a Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VADudzQGvU8&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VADudzQGvU8&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Perry Metzger has been using Emacs as his text editor since early September, 1983 -- nearly 31 years. Over much of that time, it has also been his primary way to read email, compile programs, and perform a variety of other tasks.

  Why would anyone use a single program for that long? This talk is partially intended to answer that question.

  Emacs remains one of the most important user interfaces (and text editors) for computer professionals almost 40 years after it was created. The talk is intended to be part history, part philosophy, and part speculation on the future. It will also teach Emacs fans how to explain to their skeptical friends why it is still a good idea to learn a tool from the terminal era that requires memorization of dozens of control sequences in an age of GUIs and smart phones.

      <title>Taking Notes In Emacs Org-Mode</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzZ09dAbLEE&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzZ09dAbLEE&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Emacs can be a powerful tool in organizing your life, but it can be a little intimidating if you are just getting started. I hope that this tutorial shows you that with only a few simple commands you can easily organize your thoughts and keep track of everything you need to do. You don’t need to know Emacs inside and out to take advantage of Org-Mode, and even if you only use emacs to manage your to-do list, I think you will find that the time you spent learning the program is a worthwile investment.

  Turtle graphics are a way of drawing pictures in which one provides a series of directions such as "move forward" or "turn left" to steer the pen. (The name comes from the fact that the original implementation involved a robotic turtle as an output device controlled by the computer.) In addition to providing a useful and entertaining program, this talk also discusses techniques of pbm graphics and the use of a buffer for drawing which are of general use when doing graphics in emacs.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Emacs Chat: Christopher Wellons (FFI, Emacs internals)</title>

Neat! Also, he has probably forgotten more about Emacs internals than I can understand. Join us as I chat with him about how he got into Emacs, what he does with it, and how one can get started understanding deep Emacs geekery.

  The video recording (and eventually transcript etc.) is in the public domain. Yay Christopher!</div>]]></description>

We'll be introducing Emacs Lisp by describing its simple syntax, demonstrating a few Lisp functions for manipulating buffers, regions, and strings, writing a few utility functions, and binding those functions to custom keys. By the end of the talk, you should able to do the same.

  M-x nyan-mode

  Note that the melpa package is no longer available and is unnecessary. You can just skip installing it.

After getting the basics out of the way with the built-in tutorial, we'll explore some of the games that ship with Emacs. With these simple first steps, we set out on adventure to explore the depth and complexity of a software tool more than 30 years in the making...

      <title>Emacs + org-mode + python in reproducible research; SciPy 2013 Presentation</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-dUkyn_fZA</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-dUkyn_fZA">youtube</a><br><br>Authors: Kitchin, John Carnegie Mellon University

  Track: Reproducible Science

  We will discuss the use of emacs + org-mode + python in enabling reproducible research. This combination of software enables researchers to intertwine narrative and mathematical text with figures and code that is executable within a document, with capture of the output. Portions of the document can be selectively exported to LaTeX, HTML, pdf and other other formats. We have used this method to produce technical manuscripts submitted for peer review in scientific journals, in the preparation of two e-books (about 300 pages each) on using python in scientific and engineering applications (http://jkitchin.github.com/pycse), and in using python in the modeling of the properties of materials with density functional theory (http://jkitchin.github.com/dft-book), as well as a python-powered blog at http://jkitchin.github.com. Our experience suggests all three components are critical for enabling reproducible research in practice: an extensible editor, a markup language that separates text, math, data and code, and an effective language such as python. We will show examples of the pros and cons of this particular implementation of editor/markup/code combination.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Using Python to Code by Voice</title>
      <link>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI">youtube</a><br><br>Tavis RuddTwo years ago I developed a case of Emacs Pinkie (RSI) so severe my hands went numb and I could no longer type or work. Desperate, I tried voice recognition. At first programming with it was painfully slow but, as I couldn't type, I persevered. After several months of vocab tweaking and duct-tape coding in Python and Emacs Lisp, I had a system that enabled me to code faster and more efficiently by voice than I ever had by hand.

  In a fast-paced live demo, I will create a small system using Python, plus a few other languages for good measure, and deploy it without touching the keyboard. The demo gods will make a scheduled appearance. I hope to convince you that voice recognition is no longer a crutch for the disabled or limited to plain prose. It's now a highly effective tool that could benefit all programmers.</div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQAd41VAXWo&feature=youtu.be">youtube</a><br><br>Emacs with orgtbl mode used to create a HTML table.

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7rioYkAsrA is a higher resolution version of this video with commentary included.

  http://dynamic-thinking.blogspot.com/2009/11/orgtbl-mode.html has a nice write-up inspired (?) by this video.

  Creating HTML tables by hand can be painful, however thanks to orgtbl mode (which comes with org mode) Emacs users can edit tables in friendly way and later "send" (as org mode calls it) the data into a HTML source code. Inserting new columns and rearranging them is a single key binding!

  What makes org (and orgtbl) mode even more powerful is the spreadsheet capabilities.  You can define formula which will be used to calculate values of given cell or a group of cells (ie. a column).  And because the underlying evaluation mechanism is Emacs' calc mode you can calculate almost anything! That includes integrals, differentials and Taylor's functions!

  What else has been shown on the video is the spell checker and auto completion.</div>]]></description>

      <title>Emacs Org-mode - a system for note-taking and project planning</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTwQvgfgMM&amp;pp=ygUFZW1hY3M%3D</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div id="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTwQvgfgMM&pp=ygUFZW1hY3M%3D">youtube</a><br><br>Google Tech Talks
  July 15, 2008

  ABSTRACT

   Org-mode is a large Emacs sub-systems that has been integrated into
   Emacs with the version 22.1 release. From it original intend,
   Org-mode is a system for structured note-taking and project planning.
   It uses strictly plain text files, making it a truly portable,
   system-independent solution. The project-planning features are
   implemented using a fairly simple outlining paradigm, upon which
   meta-data concepts like due dates, priorities, TODO states and tags
   are overlayed in a non-intrusive way. Besides outlining the system
   and its basic concepts, I will give background information into the
   history of Org-mode and discuss the properties of such an evolved
   system compared to a top-down designed one. Finally, I will also
   briefly touch on some technical aspects that may be interesting for
   Emacs wizards and developers.
